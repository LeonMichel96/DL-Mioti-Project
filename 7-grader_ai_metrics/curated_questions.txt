#1
Q: "I control [[Vizier of Remedies]] and [[Devoted Druid]]. Can I generate infinite Green mana?"
A: "Yes, you can. This works because the Vizier creates a replacement effect that modifies the cost of the Druid's untap ability. When you activate the Druid, the cost requires putting a -1/-1 counter on it, but the Vizier reduces that number by one, meaning you effectively pay 0 counters. Since the Druid never actually receives the counter, it doesn't shrink or die, allowing you to untap it infinitely."

Q: "I attack with [[Questing Beast]] and my opponent casts [[Fog]]. Does damage go through?"
A: "Yes, with Questing Beast attacking, casting Fog prevents damage to your opponent's creatures and planeswalkers, but NOT the combat damage Questing Beast deals to the opponent, as its ability overrides prevention effects for damage dealt by it. Questing Beast's 'combat damage can't be prevented' text stops Fog from stopping the player damage."
difficulty: "hard"

#3
Q: "If my opponent casts [[Solitude]] on my [[Ketramose]] during my turn, do I draw a card from [[Ketramose]]'s ability?"
A: "Yes, you will draw a card. Ketramose's ability is a triggered ability that looks back at the game state to see if its trigger condition was met, and it functions even if Ketramose itself leaves the battlefield as part of the event or before the ability resolves."
difficulty: "hard"

#4
Q: "I cast [[Dress Down]] and my opponent has a [[Magus of the Moon]] in play. Are my non-basic lands still mountains?"
A: "Yes, your non-basic lands will still be mountains even after casting Dress Down on Magus of the Moon, because Magus's effect (changing land types in Layer 4) applies before Dress Down's effect (removing abilities in Layer 6), meaning the lands become mountains before the Magus loses its ability to do so."
difficulty: "hard"

#5
Q: "If I cast [[Merfolk Trickster]] on [[Dryad of the Ilysian Grove]], will my opponent's [[Valakut]] see his lands as mountains?"
A: "Yes, the lands remain Mountains. This happens because type-changing effects are applied in Layer 4, whereas ability-removing effects occur later in Layer 6. Since the game applies the "Mountain" type before removing the Dryad's text, Valakut triggers will still function normally. However, the opponent does lose the specific permission to play an additional land for that turn."
difficulty: "hard"

#6
Q: "If I have an [[Urza's Saga]] on chapter II and my opponent plays a [[Blood Moon]], what happens to my [[Urza's Saga]]?"
A: "When your opponent plays Blood Moon while your Urza's Saga is on Chapter II, Urza's Saga becomes a basic Mountain, but thanks to a recent rules update (around May 2025), it doesn't get sacrificed, and it retains the abilities from previous chapters, allowing you to keep creating Construct tokens and tapping for mana, effectively becoming a powerful utility Mountain. It loses its lore counters and won't gain more, but its existing chapter abilities become usable on the Mountain."
difficulty: "hard"

#7
Q: "I cast a [[Dragonhawk, Fate's Tempest]] exiling 2 cards, but my opponent kills it right away with [[Shoot the Sheriff]]. On my end step, I still have the 2 cards in exile. Does the [[Dragonhawk]] still do damage to my opponent even if it is in the graveyard?"
A: "Yes, the Dragonhawk's end-step ability will still trigger and deal 4 damage to your opponent, even though it died, because the ability creates a delayed trigger that exists independently on the stack, separate from its source. The key is that the ability triggered and put the cards into exile and the damage effect on the stack; as long as the cards are still in exile, the delayed trigger resolves and deals damage based on those specific exiled cards."
difficulty: "hard"

#8
Q: "If my opponent controls [[The One Ring]] with 2 counters and activates it, and I exile it in response with [[Tear Asunder]], does my opponent draw 2 cards, 3 cards, or 0 cards?"
A: "Your opponent draws 2 cards. This happens because activated abilities exist independently of their source once placed on the stack; removing The One Ring does not counter the ability. Although a new burden counter cannot be added to the now-exiled card, the game uses Last Known Information to recall the two counters present when it left the battlefield, allowing the draw effect to resolve based on that count."
difficulty: "hard"

#9
Q: "If I cast [[Phantasmal Image]] on an activated [[Mutavault]], do I get a 2/2 creature that does not need activation?"
A: "No, when Phantasmal Image copies an activated Mutavault (one that's already a creature), the Image enters as a Land, not a creature, because the animation is an effect, not a copyable characteristic. It will only become a 2/2 creature and gain summoning sickness if you activate its ability after it enters, making it a land-creature that must wait until your next turn to tap for mana."
difficulty: "hard"

#10
Q: "Can I pay life to [[Bolas's Citadel]] and go to negative life if I have a [[Platinum Angel]]?"
A: "No, you cannot pay life to Bolas's Citadel and go to negative life with Platinum Angel out, because you can't pay life you don't have, even if the Angel keeps you in the game; you can only pay down to 0 life and then can't pay any more, though you can still pay 0 life to activate abilities if a cost allows it. Platinum Angel prevents you from losing the game at 0 or less life, but it doesn't change the fundamental rule that you can't spend life as a resource if your total is zero or below."
difficulty: "hard"

#11
Q: "Do I draw from [[Dark Confidant]] if my life would go to negative but I have a [[Platinum Angel]] out?
A: "Yes, you still draw from Dark Confidant even if your life goes negative with Platinum Angel out, because the Angel prevents you from losing the game, but doesn't stop your life total from becoming negative; the loss prevention only applies when state-based actions check for a loss, and you can't pay life if you have none to pay, but damage still reduces your life below zero, and Dark Confidant's effect triggers before you'd lose."
difficulty: "hard"

#12
Q: "If I discarded a nonland card to [[Grab the Prize]] and managed to copy the spell, does the copy also deal the 2 damage?
A: "Yes, the copied Grab the Prize will deal 2 damage to each opponent because copies of spells copy all choices made for the original, including additional costs, so the copy "remembers" that a nonland was discarded for the original spell and applies that effect. You don't pay additional costs for the copy, but it references the original's costs to determine its own outcome."
difficulty: "hard"

#13
Q: "If I have an active [[Purphoros, God of the Forge]] enchanted by [[Unable to Scream]], what happens if my devotion drops below 5? Does the aura fall? Is [[Purphoros]] still a Toy creature?"
A: "Purphoros remains a Toy creature, and the Aura does not fall off. This happens because both effects (Purphoros trying to revert to a non-creature enchantment and the Aura forcing him to be a Toy creature) apply in Layer 4. Since the Aura entered the battlefield later, its timestamp wins the conflict and overwrites Purphoros's natural state. Because the Aura successfully forces him to remain a creature, it stays legally attached to him regardless of your current devotion count."
difficulty: "hard"

#14
Q: "I have a [[Utopia Sprawl]] enchanting a [[Breeding Pool]], and play a [[Harbinger of the Seas]]; does the [[Utopia Sprawl]] stay on the land, or fall off?"
A: "When you play Harbinger of the Seas, it turns your enchanted Breeding Pool into an Island, making it no longer a Forest, so Utopia Sprawl falls off and goes to the graveyard because its enchantment condition (enchanting a Forest) is no longer met. Sprawl is picky and needs a Forest; when that land stops being a Forest (due to Harbinger, Blood Moon, or Spreading Seas), the Sprawl loses its target and ceases to exist."
difficulty: "hard"

#15
Q: "If I have a [[Chalice of the Void]] with 0 counters and my opponent plays a [[Walking Ballista]] paying 4 mana? Does the [[Ballista]] get countered? What is its CMC on the stack?"
A: "No, the Walking Ballista will not be countered by a Chalice of the Void with zero counters. When a spell with X in its mana cost is on the stack, the value of X is the number chosen for it when it was cast. The mana value (formerly converted mana cost or CMC) of the spell is calculated using that chosen value for X; in this case it would be 4." 
difficulty: "hard"

#16
Q: "I cast [[Taunting Elf]] and have a [[Jaspera Sentinel]] in play. Can I use the Sentinel to tap the Elf for mana right away? Or the Elf's summoning sickness prevents me from that?"
A: "Yes, you can use the Jaspera Sentinel to tap the Taunting Elf for mana right away. Summoning sickness only prevents a creature from attacking or using its OWN abilities if they involve the tap symbol or the untap symbol as a cost".
difficulty: "hard"

#17
Q: "If I cast [[Seasoned Pyromancer]] with an exerted [[Arena of Glory]], creating 2 elemental tokens, do the tokens have haste too?"
A: "No, the tokens do not have haste. Arena of Glory specifies that "Creatures cast this way gain haste," which grants haste only to the Seasoned Pyromancer itself because it is the spell that was cast using the mana. The Elemental tokens are generated by a triggered ability after the Pyromancer enters the battlefield, not by the casting of the spell, so they do not receive the bonus from the land."
difficulty: "hard"

#18
Q: "If I cast [[Treachery]] on an opponent's [[Eidolon of Blossoms]], do I draw a card? If so, what is the rule?
A: Yes. You control the Eidolon as soon as Treachery enters. Then the Eidolon sees that another enchantment you control entered, and triggers. You'll draw a card. This is defined by Rule 611.3c, which establishes that continuous effects generated by a permanent apply simultaneously with its entry into the battlefield. Because the control change happens at the exact same moment Treachery lands, the game state sees you as the controller of the Eidolon in time for it to see the enchantment enter."
difficulty: "hard"

#19
Q: "If I cast [[Ephemerate]] on my [[Master of Waves]] with 4 Elemental tokens out, do the tokens die?"
A: No, the tokens do not die. This happens because State-Based Actions (which check for creatures with 0 toughness) are not performed in the middle of a resolving spell. Although the Master of Waves leaves play briefly (removing the +1/+1 bonus), he returns immediately. By the time the spell finishes resolving and the game actually checks the board state, the Master is back and the tokens are safe with the bonus reapplied."
difficulty: "hard"

#20
Q: If I cast [[Clone]] on a creature enchanted with [[Lignify]], will it copy the original creature or a 0/4 Treefolk?
A: "If you cast Clone on a creature enchanted with Lignify, your Clone will copy the original creature, not the 0/4 Treefolk, because Lignify's effect changes the creature's characteristics but isn't part of its "copiable values" (like name, mana cost, text, P/T from abilities) that Clone copies. Clone copies what's printed on the card, and Lignify's continuous effect is applied after the copy is made, so your Clone will be a copy of the base creature with its own abilities, not a Treefolk."
difficulty: "hard"

#21
Q: "If [[Phantasmal Image]] is copying a black creature, can I kill it with [[Terror]]?"
A: "No, you cannot kill it with Terror. This is because Phantasmal Image copies all characteristics of the original creature, including its color. Since it is now a black creature, it is not a legal target for Terror (which targets only nonblack creatures). Because you cannot legally cast the spell targeting it, the Image's 'sacrifice when targeted' ability never triggers."
difficulty: "hard"

#22
Q: "Can I destroy a [[Phantasmal Bear]] using [[Hydroblast]], since I can target it?"
A: "Yes, the Bear will die. This happens because Hydroblast allows you to target any permanent, regardless of its color (unlike Blue Elemental Blast, which requires a red target). Even though Hydroblast would fail to destroy a blue creature upon resolution, the mere act of targeting the Phantasmal Bear triggers its sacrifice ability first. The Bear sacrifices itself and leaves the battlefield before Hydroblast effectively resolves."
difficulty: "hard"

#23
Q: "Does [[Wasteland Strangler]] need a card in exile for its ability to work? If I cast [[Strangler]] on my opponent's [[Phantasmal Bear]] while he does not have cards in exile? Can I target the bear so it dies?"
A: "Yes, the Bear will die. This happens because Wasteland Strangler's ability requires you to choose a target *when the ability is put on the stack*, not when it resolves. You are allowed (and required) to target a creature even if there are no cards in exile to process. The moment you target the Phantasmal Bear, its sacrifice ability triggers and resolves immediately, killing the Bear before the Strangler's ability checks to see if you can pay the cost."
difficulty: "hard"

#24
Q: "I cast [[Tidehollow Sculler]]. In response to its 'enter the battlefield' ability, I cast [[Cloudshift]] on it. What happens?"
A: "You exile one card permanently and a second card temporarily. This happens because Cloudshift forces the Sculler's 'leaves' trigger to resolve before its first 'enters' trigger has grabbed a card. The return effect fires on nothing, and then the original entry trigger resolves, locking that first card away forever because its return condition has already passed. The re-entered Sculler then triggers again to take a second card normally."
difficulty: "hard"

#25
Q: "Can I activate my [[Spellskite]] in response to my opponent trying to equip his creature with [[Shadowspear]]? Will the [[Shadowspear]] equip [[Spellskite]] instead?"
A: "You can activate Spellskite, but the redirection will fail. This happens because the **Equip** keyword specifically targets a creature **controlled by the player activating the ability**. Since your opponent controls the equip ability but does not control your Spellskite, your creature is an illegal target for that specific ability. The target remains unchanged, and the Shadowspear will attach to the opponent's creature as originally intended."
difficulty: "hard"

#26
Q: "If my opponent cast a [[Fatal Push]] on my creature, can I use [[Aether Vial]] in response to put [[Unsettled Mariner]] into play and force him to pay 1 more mana?"
A: "No, the opponent does not have to pay. This happens because Unsettled Mariner triggers only at the specific moment a permanent becomes the target of a spell. By the time you receive priority to activate Aether Vial, Fatal Push has already been cast and the target established. Since the Mariner arrives on the battlefield after the targeting event has already finished, its ability effectively missed the moment to trigger."
difficulty: "hard"

#27
Q: "I cast [[Supernatural Stamina]] on [[Elenda, the Dusk Rose]] in response to a board wipe. When she dies and returns, does she get counters from the other creatures dying? Does the token generation count the +2/+0 buff?"
A: "You create tokens based on her buffed power, but the returned Elenda receives no counters. This happens because the token generation relies on Last Known Information to check her power (including the +2/+0) at the moment of death. However, the Elenda that returns is a completely new object; she arrives after the board wipe is complete, so she effectively missed the event of the other creatures dying."
difficulty: "hard"

#28
Q: "Can I use the processor ability of [[Oracle of Dust]] when there is a [[Rest in Peace]] in play?"
A: "Yes, you can use the ability. This works because paying a cost only requires you to attempt the specified action, even if a replacement effect changes the final outcome. When you move the opponent's card from exile to the graveyard to pay Oracle's cost, Rest in Peace intercepts it and sends it right back to exile. The game considers the cost paid because the card legally left the exile zone (becoming a new object), even though it ended up returning there immediately, allowing you to draw and discard."
difficulty: "hard"

#29
Q: "If I use [[Snapcaster Mage]] to flashback [[Approach of the Second Sun]], where would it go when it resolves?
A: "It will be exiled. This happens because Flashback creates a strict replacement effect: if the spell would leave the stack to go anywhere other than exile, it is exiled instead. Even though Approach of the Second Sun specifically instructs you to put it into your library, the Flashback rule intercepts that movement and forces the card into the exile zone."
difficulty: "hard"

#30
Q: "If a [[Field-Tested Frying Pan]] enters the battlefield while I control [[Peregrin Took]], how many food tokens would I create in total?"
A: "You will create three Food tokens and one Halfling token. This happens because Field-Tested Frying Pan generates tokens using two separate instructions: first creating a Food, then creating a Halfling. Peregrin Took's replacement effect sees two distinct token-creation events and applies to each one individually, adding an extra Food to the first event (making two Foods) and an extra Food to the second event (making one Halfling and one Food)."
difficulty: "hard"

#31
Q: "If I manifest [[Nexus of Fate]] with [[Abhorrent Oculus]] and the manifested creature dies, will [[Nexus of Fate]]'s replacement trigger activate and put it back in library or does it simply hit the graveyard stay there?"
A: "It will stay in the graveyard. This happens because face-down creatures have no text or abilities, meaning the replacement effect (shuffle into library) simply does not exist at the moment the creature dies. Since replacement effects must exist before an event occurs to modify it, the game treats it as a vanilla 2/2 dying; by the time the card is revealed in the graveyard, the transition is complete and it is too late to apply the shuffle effect."
difficulty: "hard"

#32
Q: If I turn a manifested creature face-up in response to [[Path to Exile]], does the spell fizzle?
A: The creature will be exiled. This happens because turning a creature face-up does not make it a new object; it remains the exact same permanent on the battlefield, merely changing its visible characteristics. Since the creature is still a legal target for the spell (it is still a creature and usually hasn't gained protection or hexproof), Path to Exile resolves and exiles it normally.
difficulty: "hard"

#33
Q: "If [[Brawn]] is in my graveyard and I control only a [[Snow-Covered Forest]], will my creatures still have Trample?"
A: "Yes, your creatures will have trample. This happens because Brawn's ability checks for the subtype Forest, not for a card specifically named Forest. Since Snow-Covered Forests possess the Forest subtype line, they satisfy the condition required to grant the bonus."
difficulty: "hard"

#34
Q: "If I have a [[Cecil, Dark Knight]] transformed into [[Cecil, Redeemed Paladin]], can I play a second [[Cecil, Dark Knight]] or will the legend rule make me sacrifice one?"
A: "You can keep both. This happens because the Legend Rule applies only when you control two or more legendary permanents with the exact same name. Since the transformed side (Cecil, Redeemed Paladin) has a completely different name than the front side of the new copy (Cecil, Dark Knight), the game treats them as distinct entities, allowing them to coexist on the battlefield."
difficulty: "hard"

#35
Q: "I cast a [[Clown Car]], while I control [[Omarthis, Ghostfire Initiate]]. Will [[Omarthis]] get a counter for each counter [[Clown Car]] gets or just one?"
A: "Just one counter. This happens because Omarthis triggers whenever one or more counters are placed, treating the simultaneous placement of multiple counters as a single event. Since Clown Car enters with all its counters at the exact same moment, Omarthis sees this as a single instance of adding counters and triggers only once, regardless of how large X is."
difficulty: "hard"

#36
Q: "If my opponent has a [[Platinum Emperion]] out and I attack with [[Etali, Primal Sickness]] and they didn't block, would they still get the poison counters even though their life total can't change?"
A: "Yes, they will get the counters and lose the game. This happens because Platinum Emperion prevents changes to life totals but does not prevent damage from being dealt. Etali successfully deals its damage (even though the life total doesn't change), triggering its ability to assign 11 poison counters. Since poison counters function independently of life totals, they are applied normally, and the opponent immediately dies from having 10 or more poison counters."
difficulty: "hard"

#37
Q: "If I have a [[Tajuru Blightblade]] and cast [[Blizzard Brawl]] targetting it and a 5/5 creature, does [[Blightblade]] kill that creature?"
A: "Yes, the 5/5 creature will die. This happens because the Fight mechanic causes the creatures to deal damage equal to their power to each other directly. Since Tajuru Blightblade has Deathtouch, any amount of damage it deals is considered lethal. Even if the Blightblade dies from the 5 damage it takes in return (assuming you don't meet the Snow requirement for Indestructible), the 1 damage it inflicts is enough to destroy the opponent's creature."
difficulty: "hard"

#38
Q: "If I have a [[Phyrexian Obliterator]] and cast [[Blizzard Brawl]] targetting it and a 5/5 creature, does my opponent have to sacrifice 5 permanents?"
A: "Yes, the opponent must sacrifice 5 permanents. This happens because the Fight mechanic causes the creatures to deal damage to each other directly. Even though you cast the spell, the damage dealt to your Phyrexian Obliterator comes from the opponent's creature (the source). Since the Obliterator triggers whenever a source deals damage to it, the ability activates and forces the controller of that source (your opponent) to sacrifice permanents equal to the damage dealt."
difficulty: "hard"

#39
Q: "I control [[Ghostly Prison]] and activate [[Nahiri, the Unforgiving]] +1 ability. Does this force my opponent to pay 2 mana to attack me?"
A: "No, they do not have to pay. This happens because the rules for combat requirements state that a player is never forced to pay a cost (like mana or life) to fulfill a requirement to attack. Your opponent can simply choose not to pay the 2. However, if there is another opponent they can attack for free (in a multiplayer game), they must attack that player to satisfy Nahiri's requirement."
difficulty: "hard"

#40
Q: "If [[Blightbeetle]] blocks a green creature with trample is the excess damage still applied to the defending player?"
A: "Yes, the excess damage hits the player. This happens because Trample assigns damage based on the blocker's toughness, ignoring prevention effects like Protection. The green creature assigns just enough damage to kill the Blightbeetle (normally 1 damage), and the rest tramples over. The damage assigned to the Beetle is prevented."
difficulty: "hard"

#41
Q: "Do I need to have [[The Omenkeel]] in play to play the lands exiled with it?"
A: "No, you do not need it in play. This happens because the permission to play the lands is part of the triggered ability's resolution, not a separate static ability. When the ability resolves, it sets up a lasting permission that applies to those specific cards for as long as they remain exiled. Even if The Omenkeel leaves the battlefield, that permission persists."
difficulty: "hard"

#42
Q: "Can I play [[Consign to Memory]] to avoid paying the Ward 4 cost of [[Kappa Cannoneer]] and kill it with [[Dismember]]?"
A: "Yes, you can. This happens because Ward is a triggered ability, and Consign to Memory has a mode that specifically counters target triggered ability. You can legally target and counter the Ward trigger, removing the requirement to pay 4."
difficulty: "hard"

#43
Q: "If I control an [[Encroaching Mycosynth]], does [[Karn, the Great Creator]] -2 ability allow me to get any card from my sideboard/outside the game?"
A: "No, you cannot get non-artifact cards from your sideboard. This happens because static abilities on the battlefield (like Encroaching Mycosynth) only affect objects within the game's zones (Library, Hand, Graveyard, Exile, Stack, Command). The sideboard is considered "outside the game," so the cards there remain unchanged. You can still only fetch cards that are naturally artifacts."
difficulty: "hard"

#44
Q: "If I target my [[Walking Ballista]] with [[Heliod, Sun-Crowned]] ability, does [[Ballista]] go infinite?"
A: "Yes, this creates an infinite damage loop, provided Walking Ballista has at least two +1/+1 counters. This happens because Heliod grants the Ballista Lifelink. When you remove a counter to deal damage, you gain life, which triggers Heliod to put a +1/+1 counter back on the Ballista. This effectively refunds the cost of the ability, allowing you to repeat the process indefinitely until you win. The Ballista must be a 2/2 or larger so it doesn't die when you remove the first counter."
difficulty: "hard"

#45
Q: "If I cast [[Sculpting Steel]] as a copy of [[Cityscape Leveler]], do I get the 'When you cast this spell' trigger?"
A: "No, you do not get the trigger. This happens because 'When you cast this spell' triggers fire the moment the spell is placed on the stack. At that specific moment, the card is still just Sculpting Steel and does not have the text of the Leveler. It only becomes a copy as it resolves and enters the battlefield, which is long after the cast event has already occurred."
difficulty: "hard"

#46
Q: "I have a [[Vodalian Hexcatcher]] in play and multiple other merfolk creatures, and my opponent plays a noncreature spell. Can I sacrifice a merfolk then if my opponent decides to pay 1, sacrifice another one, and so on?"
A: "This happens because objects on the stack resolve individually, and players receive priority again after each resolution. When your first activation resolves and the opponent pays the 1, their original spell is still on the stack waiting to resolve. Before it can resolve, the game must pass priority to you again, giving you the opportunity to activate the Hexcatcher a second time, sacrifice another Merfolk, and force them to pay another 1. You can repeat this taxing process until you run out of Merfolk or they run out of mana."
difficulty: "hard"

#47
Q: "I control four copies of [[Hare Apparent]] and cast [[Ghostway]]. When they all return to the battlefield simultaneously, how many tokens do I create? Does each Hare see the other three?
A: "Yes, you are correct; you will create 12 tokens. This happens because when multiple creatures enter the battlefield at the same time, they all "see" each other for the purpose of triggering abilities. Each of the four Hare Apparents looks at the board, sees exactly three other Hare Apparents entering alongside it, and triggers to create three tokens."
difficulty: "hard"

#48
Q: "I am casting an opponent's card exiled with [[Gonti, Lord of Luxury]]. In response, he plays [[Aven Interrupter]] targeting that spell. Does the card go to my exile or the owner's exile, and who gets to cast it later?"
A: "It goes to the owner's exile, and the owner gets to cast it later. This happens because Aven Interrupter causes the spell to become Plotted. The rules for the Plot mechanic specifically state that the card's owner (not the player who controlled the spell on the stack) gains the permission to cast it from exile on a later turn without paying its mana cost."
difficulty: "hard"

#49
Q: "I control [[Nomads en-Kor]] and [[Needletooth Raptor]], and my opponent casts a spell that deals 2 damage to all creatures. If I activate [[Nomads en-Kor]] twice to redirect the damage it would take to the [[Needletooth Raptor]], will its Enrage ability trigger one, two, or three times?"
A: "It triggers just once. This happens because damage redirection creates a replacement effect that modifies the original damage event without splitting it up. The game sees a single simultaneous event where the spell deals 0 damage to the Nomads and 4 damage (2 natural + 2 redirected) to the Needletooth Raptor."
difficulty: "hard"

#50
Q: "If I control a creature that I stole with [[Act of Treason]], and I use [[Cloudshift]] on it, do I keep it forever?"
A: "Yes, you keep it permanently. This happens because Cloudshift exiles the creature and returns it specifically 'under your control.' When the creature leaves and returns, it becomes a brand new game object. The temporary 'until end of turn' effect from [[Act of Treason]] loses track of it, and since you are the controller of the 'new' creature upon entry, it stays yours indefinitely."
difficulty: "hard"

#51
Q: "When can I play a Sorcery spell?"
A: "You can only play a Sorcery spell during your own Main Phase (either the first or second), and only when the stack is empty. You cannot play it during your opponent's turn or during combat."
difficulty: "easy"

#52
Q: "Can I block a creature that has Flying with a creature that does not have Flying or Reach?"
A: "No, you cannot. A creature with Flying can only be blocked by other creatures with Flying or creatures with the Reach keyword. A ground creature without Reach cannot interact with a flier."
difficulty: "easy"

#53
Q: "If my opponent attacks me with a 2/2 creature, can I block with two 1/1 creatures?"
A: "Yes, you can. This is called a 'double block' or 'gang block.' You can assign multiple creatures to block a single attacking creature. The attacker determines the order in which damage is dealt to your blockers."
difficulty: "easy"

#54
Q: "Does damage dealt to a creature stay on it forever?"
A: "No. Damage marked on a creature remains until the 'Cleanup Step' at the very end of the turn. If the damage isn't lethal by then, it is removed completely. The creature starts the next turn fresh."
difficulty: "easy"

#55
Q: "I have a creature with Haste. Can I attack with it the turn I play it?"
A: "Yes. Normally, creatures suffer from 'summoning sickness' and cannot attack or tap for abilities the turn they come under your control. The Haste keyword specifically ignores this rule, allowing immediate attacks."
difficulty: "easy"

#56
Q: "Can I play an Instant spell during my opponent's turn?"
A: "Yes. Instant spells can be cast at any time you have priority, including during your opponent's turn, in response to their spells, or during combat."
difficulty: "easy"

#57
Q: "If I have unspent mana in my mana pool at the end of my Main Phase, can I save it for my opponent's turn?"
A: "No. Mana empties from your mana pool at the end of every step and phase. If you do not use it before moving to the next step (like moving from Main Phase to Combat), it is lost."
difficulty: "easy"

#58
Q: "What happens if I have to draw a card but my library is empty?"
A: "You lose the game immediately. Attempting to draw from an empty library is one of the primary lose conditions in Magic: The Gathering."
difficulty: "easy"

#59
Q: "Can I target a creature with Hexproof with my own spells?"
A: "Yes, you can. Hexproof prevents a permanent from being targeted by spells or abilities your *opponents* control. It does not prevent you (the controller) from targeting it with your own buffs or enchantments."
difficulty: "easy"

#60
Q: "If I block a 5/5 creature with a 1/1 creature, do I take 4 damage?"
A: "No, you take 0 damage. Unless the attacking creature has Trample, a blocker absorbs all combat damage from the attacker, regardless of the size difference. The 1/1 will die, but you will be safe."
difficulty: "easy"

#61
Q: "When do I untap my lands and creatures?"
A: "You untap your permanents during the 'Untap Step,' which is the very first thing that happens on your turn, before you draw a card or play anything."
difficulty: "easy"

#62
Q: "Can I counter a Land card when my opponent plays it?"
A: "No. Playing a land is a special action that does not use the stack. Because it does not go on the stack, it cannot be responded to or countered by spells like Counterspell."
difficulty: "easy"

Q: "Does a creature with Deathtouch kill a player if it deals 1 damage to them?"
A: "No. Deathtouch only applies to damage dealt to other creatures. If a Deathtouch creature hits a player, it just deals normal damage to their life total."
difficulty: "easy"

#64
Q: "Can I equip an Artifact Equipment to a creature at Instant speed?"
A: "No. The Equip keyword can only be activated as a Sorcery. This means you can only do it during your Main Phase when the stack is empty, not in response to removal or during combat."
difficulty: "easy"

#65
Q: "My opponent casts a spell. Can I cast a spell in response before theirs resolves?"
A: "Yes. Magic uses a system called 'The Stack.' When a spell is cast, it goes on top of the stack. You can respond with an Instant or ability, which goes on top of theirs and will resolve first."
difficulty: "easy"

#66
Q: "If a creature is Indestructible, does it die if it takes damage equal to its toughness?"
A: "No. Indestructible prevents a creature from being destroyed by lethal damage or effects that say 'destroy.' It can still take damage, but the damage will not cause it to go to the graveyard."
difficulty: "easy"

#67
Q: "Can I attack a specific creature my opponent controls?"
A: "No. In Magic, you attack the player (or a Planeswalker). You declare your attackers, and then the defending player decides which of their creatures will block your attackers. You cannot force an attack directly onto a specific creature unless you use a specific 'Fight' spell."
difficulty: "easy"

#68
Q: "What is the difference between an Artifact and an Enchantment?"
A: "Mechanically, they are similar (permanent cards that sit on the board). The main difference is that Artifacts are usually colorless and represent objects or machines, while Enchantments are usually colored and represent magical effects or laws. They are affected by different removal spells."
difficulty: "easy"

#69
Q: "Can I tap a creature with Vigilance to make mana with [[Gene Pollinator]]'s ability?"
A: "Yes. Vigilance specifically means the creature does not tap when it attacks. It does not prevent the creature from being tapped for other reasons. In fact, you can attack with it (keeping it untapped) and then tap it to activate the Pollinator in the same turn."
difficulty: "easy"

#70
Q: "Do Token creatures go to the graveyard when they die?"
A: "Technically, yes. Tokens do hit the graveyard, triggering 'when a creature dies' abilities. However, they cease to exist immediately after arriving there. They cannot be returned to your hand or battlefield from the graveyard."
difficulty: "easy"

#71
Q: "If I have two Legendary creatures with the exact same name on the battlefield, what happens?"
A: "You must choose one to keep and put the other into your graveyard immediately. This is known as the 'Legend Rule.'"
difficulty: "easy"

#72
Q: "Can I play a creature before I play a land on my turn?"
A: "Yes. As long as it is your Main Phase and you have the mana available (perhaps from artifacts or creatures), you can perform actions in any order. You are not required to play a land first."
difficulty: "easy"

#73
Q: "If a creature has Vigilance, what does that mean?"
A: "It means attacking does not cause the creature to tap. Normally, attacking requires tapping. A Vigilance creature stays upright, meaning it can attack on your turn and still be available to block on your opponent's turn."
difficulty: "easy"

#74
Q: "What is 'Milling'?"
A: "Milling refers to putting cards directly from the top of a library into the graveyard. It does not count as drawing cards. If a player is forced to mill their entire deck, they lose the next time they are required to draw a card."
difficulty: "easy"

#75
Q: "Does a -5/-5 effect kill an Indestructible 3/4 creature?"
A: "Yes. Indestructible prevents destruction from damage or 'destroy' effects. However, if a creature's toughness is reduced to 0 or less by -X/-X effects, it is put into the graveyard as a State-Based Action. This is not 'destruction,' so Indestructible does not save it."
difficulty: "easy"

#76
Q: "If my 2/2 creature with Double Strike is blocked by a 2/2 creature without abilities, what happens?"
A: "Your creature survives, and the opponent's creature dies. Double Strike allows your creature to deal damage in the 'First Strike' damage step. It deals 2 damage to the blocker first, killing it before the blocker gets a chance to deal its combat damage back in the normal damage step."
difficulty: "medium"

#77
Q: "I have a creature with Menace. Can my opponent block it with one creature?"
A: "No. Menace requires that the creature be blocked by two or more creatures. If the opponent only has one creature (or only wants to use one), they cannot block your Menace creature at all."
difficulty: "medium"

#78
Q: "If I cast [[Clone]] copying a creature that has three +1/+1 counters on it, does my [[Clone]] enter with those counters?"
A: "No. Copy effects only copy what is written on the card (plus other copy effects). They do not copy 'external' modifications like counters, Auras, or temporary buffs (like Giant Growth). Your Clone will enter as a fresh version of that creature with zero counters."
difficulty: "medium"

#79
Q: "Can I use [[Lightning Bolt]] to destroy a Planeswalker?"
A: "Yes. Any spell or ability that says 'any target' can target a Planeswalker directly. If the damage deals enough to remove all the Planeswalker's loyalty counters, it is put into the graveyard."
difficulty: "medium"

#80
Q: "If I attack with a creature and my opponent blocks it, and then I use [[Unsummon]] to return the blocker to their hand, does my creature deal damage to the opponent?"
A: "No (unless your creature has Trample). Once a creature is blocked, it remains blocked for the rest of combat, even if the blocker disappears. Since there is no creature left to hit, your creature deals no combat damage."
difficulty: "medium"

#81
Q: "Does a creature with Protection from Red take damage from a red 'wrath' effect like [[Blasphemous Act]]?"
A: "No, it does not take damage. Protection prevents D.E.B.T. (Damage, Enchanting/Equipping, Blocking, Targeting). Since Blasphemous Act tries to deal damage, Protection prevents it. However, a red spell that says 'Destroy all creatures' (without damage) would still kill it."
difficulty: "medium"

#82
Q: "If I cast a spell and my opponent casts [[Counterspell]] targeting it, can I cast another instant in response to prevent it from being countered?"
A: "Yes. Because spells on the stack resolve in 'Last In, First Out' order, the Counterspell has not resolved yet. You can respond with your own spell (like [[Dispel]] or [[Veil of Summer]]) on top of theirs. Your response will resolve first, neutralizing or invalidating the Counterspell before it can affect your original spell."
difficulty: "medium"

#83
Q: "If I have a creature with Ward 2 and my opponent targets it with a spell but cannot pay the 2, what happens to their spell?"
A: "Their spell is countered. Ward is a triggered ability that triggers when the creature is targeted. If the opponent does not pay the cost upon resolution of that trigger, their spell is countered by the game rules."
difficulty: "medium"

#84
Q: "Does First Strike work when creatures 'fight' using a spell like [[Prey Upon]]?"
A: "No. First Strike and Double Strike only apply during specific Combat Damage steps. 'Fight' is a spell effect that causes two creatures to deal damage equal to their power to each other simultaneously. Combat keywords are ignored."
difficulty: "medium"

#85
Q: "If I create a token copy of a card with Mana Value (CMC) 5, what is the Mana Value of the token?"
A: "The token has a Mana Value of 5. Unlike generic tokens (like a 1/1 Soldier) which have a Mana Value of 0, a token that is a *copy* of a card copies all characteristics of the original, including its Mana Cost."
difficulty: "medium"

#86
Q: "Can I activate a Planeswalker ability during my opponent's turn?"
A: "No. Unless an ability specifically says otherwise (like The Wandering Emperor), Planeswalker loyalty abilities can only be activated as a Sorcery: during your Main Phase, when the stack is empty."
difficulty: "medium"

#87
Q: "If I have a 1/1 creature with both Deathtouch and First Strike, and it blocks a 10/10 creature without abilities, does my creature die?"
A: "No, your creature survives. Because of First Strike, your creature deals damage in the first combat damage step. Because of Deathtouch, that 1 damage is immediately lethal. The 10/10 dies and is removed from combat before the regular damage step occurs, so it never gets a chance to hit your creature back."
difficulty: "medium"

#88
Q: "I control [[Doubling Season]] and [[Parallel Lives]]. If I activate [[Luminarch Ascension]] to create a single 4/4 Angel token, how many Angels do I actually get?"
A: "You get 4 Angels. This happens because both enchantments generate replacement effects that modify the token creation event. The first effect sees you creating 1 token and doubles it to 2. The second effect sees the modified event of creating 2 tokens and doubles it again to 4."
difficulty: "medium"

#89
Q: "What is the difference between 'Graveyard' and 'Exile'?"
A: "The Graveyard is where cards go when they die, are discarded, or countered. Many cards interact with the graveyard (reanimation, flashback). Exile is a separate zone (formerly 'removed from the game') where cards go when specifically banished. Very few cards can bring things back from Exile."
difficulty: "medium"

#90
Q: "If I cast an Adventure creature spell (like [[Bonecrusher Giant]]), does it go to the graveyard after it resolves?"
A: "Yes. If you cast the *creature* side, it enters the battlefield. If it dies later, it goes to the graveyard. If you cast the Adventure side (Stomp), it goes to Exile on a special adventure zone after resolving, allowing you to cast the creature later."
difficulty: "medium"

#91
Q: "My opponent casts [[Deadly Dispute]]. Can I kill the creature they are sacrificing in response to make the spell fizzle?"
A: "No, you cannot. Sacrificing the creature is an **additional cost** to cast the spell. Costs are paid immediately, before the spell even goes onto the stack. By the time you receive priority to respond, the creature is already in the graveyard, so you cannot target it with removal."
difficulty: "medium"

#92
Q: "If I attack with a creature with Deathtouch and Trample and it gets blocked, how much damage do I need to assign to the blocker?"
A: "When your creature with Deathtouch and Trample gets blocked, you only need to assign 1 damage to the blocker to kill it (due to Deathtouch), and then you can assign any remaining damage to the defending player or planeswalker (thanks to Trample). This is because Deathtouch makes any amount of damage lethal, so 1 damage is enough to satisfy the "lethal damage" requirement for Trample, allowing the rest to trample over."
difficulty: "medium"

#93
Q: "Does [[Garruk's Harbinger]] (which has Hexproof from Black) survive a [[Damnation]]?"
A: "No, it does not survive. This happens because Hexproof from Black only prevents the creature from being targeted by black spells or abilities. Damnation does not use the word 'target'—it simply says 'destroy all creatures.' Since it affects the board globally without targeting specific objects, the Hexproof offers no protection, and the Harbinger is destroyed."
difficulty: "medium"

#94
Q: "If I cast [[Banishing Light]] and my opponent destroys it while its 'enters the battlefield' trigger is still on the stack, is the target exiled forever?"
A: "No, the target is never exiled at all. This happens because Banishing Light uses a modern single-paragraph wording ('exile... until Banishing Light leaves'). If the enchantment leaves the battlefield before the trigger resolves, the duration of the exile effect expires before it can even begin. The ability sees that the card is already gone and does nothing."
difficulty: "medium"

#95
Q: "Can I look at my sideboard during a game?"
A: "No. You may only look at your sideboard between games in a match. You cannot reference it or notes during the game itself (unless a card like 'Wish' specifically lets you access it)."
difficulty: "medium"

#96
Q: "I am attacking with a Lifelink creature (without Trample). My opponent blocks it, then sacrifices his creature. Do I still gain life?
A: "No, you do not gain life. This happens because a blocked creature without Trample deals damage only to the creature blocking it. If the blocker is removed before damage calculation, the attacker is still considered blocked but assigns zero damage because there is nothing left to hit. Since Lifelink requires actual damage to be dealt to function, you gain no life."
difficulty: "medium"

#97
Q: "I control [[Monastery Swiftspear]]. If I cast [[Shattering Spree]] and pay the Replicate cost twice, do I get 1 or 3 Prowess triggers?"
A: "You get only 1 trigger. This happens because Prowess triggers specifically when you cast a spell. Replicate creates copies that are placed directly onto the stack; these copies are not 'cast.' Therefore, Swiftspear sees only the original spell being cast, regardless of how many copies you make."
difficulty: "medium"

#98
Q: "I have a [[Monastery Swiftspear]] and need one more Prowess trigger to win. Can I cast [[Spell Pierce]] even if there are no other spells on the stack, just to get the trigger?"
A: "No, you cannot. To cast a spell, you must be able to choose a legal target for it. Spell Pierce specifically requires a 'target noncreature spell' to be on the stack. If there are no spells on the stack to target, the game does not allow you to cast Spell Pierce at all, so Prowess never triggers."
difficulty: "medium"

#99
Q: "If I attack with a creature with Trample and it becomes blocked, and I kill the blocker before the damage step, does the damage from my creature go through?"
A: "Yes, all the damage goes through. This happens because Trample modifies the rules for blocked creatures. While a normal creature deals no damage if its blocker is removed, a creature with Trample checks to see how much damage is needed to kill the blocker. Since there is no blocker present, the required amount is zero, allowing the full power of the attacking creature to trample over to the defending player."
difficulty: "medium"

#100
Q: "If I crew a Vehicle to attack, at what specific moment does it stop being a creature?"
A: "It stops being a creature during the Cleanup Step, which is the very last part of the turn. It remains a creature throughout combat, the second main phase, and the end step. It only reverts to being a non-creature artifact when 'until end of turn' effects wear off as the turn officially closes."
difficulty: "medium"
