1,I control [[Vizier of Remedies]] and [[Devoted Druid]]. Can I generate infinite Green mana?,"Yes, you can. This works because the Vizier creates a replacement effect that modifies the cost of the Druid's untap ability. When you activate the Druid, the cost requires putting a -1/-1 counter on it, but the Vizier reduces that number by one, meaning you effectively pay 0 counters. Since the Druid never actually receives the counter, it doesn't shrink or die, allowing you to untap it infinitely.",hard,"Costs, Mana & Casting Requirements","Ah, the pursuit of infinite mana—a most tantalizing endeavor! Let us dissect the interaction between Vizier of Remedies and Devoted Druid to ascertain whether such a feat is achievable.

### 1. The Interaction
The key cards in question are Vizier of Remedies, which modifies the number of -1/-1 counters placed on creatures you control, and Devoted Druid, which can untap itself by putting a -1/-1 counter on itself.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
1. **Activating Devoted Druid's Ability**: When you activate Devoted Druid's ability to untap it, you must pay the cost of putting a -1/-1 counter on it. Normally, this would result in a -1/-1 counter being placed on Devoted Druid, reducing its toughness from 0/2 to -1/2, which would send it to the graveyard.

2. **Vizier of Remedies' Effect**: However, since you control Vizier of Remedies, the number of -1/-1 counters placed on Devoted Druid is reduced by one. Thus, instead of receiving one -1/-1 counter, it receives zero. This means that Devoted Druid remains on the battlefield with 0 toughness, allowing you to activate its ability without it being sent to the graveyard.

3. **Untapping and Repeating**: After putting zero -1/-1 counters on Devoted Druid, it remains on the battlefield and is untapped. You can then tap it again to generate {G} mana. You can repeat this process indefinitely, as each activation results in no -1/-1 counters being placed on Devoted Druid, allowing it to remain in play.

### 3. The Ruling
Yes, you can generate infinite green mana by repeatedly activating Devoted Druid's ability while controlling Vizier of Remedies.

### Sources
[[Vizier of Remedies]], [Rule 701.44a (Mana Abilities)]  
[[Devoted Druid]], [Rule 605.2 (Mana Abilities)]",Yes,5,CORRECT,"The Bot's final answer in '### 3. The Ruling' correctly states that you can generate infinite green mana by repeatedly activating Devoted Druid's ability while controlling Vizier of Remedies. This aligns perfectly with the Ground Truth, which explains the interaction and the mechanics involved. The Bot also provides a detailed and accurate breakdown of the interaction in '### 2. The Logic', supporting the ruling with the correct understanding of the effects of both cards."
2,I attack with [[Questing Beast]] and my opponent casts [[Fog]]. Does damage go through?,"Yes, with Questing Beast attacking, casting Fog prevents damage to your opponent's creatures and planeswalkers, but NOT the combat damage Questing Beast deals to the opponent, as its ability overrides prevention effects for damage dealt by it. Questing Beast's 'combat damage can't be prevented' text stops Fog from stopping the player damage.",hard,Combat & Damage Mechanics,"Ah, the intricacies of combat and damage prevention! Let us delve into the mechanics at play here.

### 1. The Interaction
You are attacking with **Questing Beast**, a formidable creature with the ability to deal combat damage that cannot be prevented. Your opponent responds by casting **Fog**, an instant that prevents all combat damage that would be dealt this turn.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Questing Beast's Abilities**: Notably, Questing Beast has the ability that states, ""Combat damage that would be dealt by creatures you control can't be prevented."" This is a crucial aspect of its design, as it directly interacts with any effects that attempt to prevent combat damage.
  
- **Fog's Effect**: Fog attempts to prevent all combat damage that would be dealt this turn. However, since Questing Beast's ability explicitly states that combat damage it deals cannot be prevented, we must consider the implications of this interaction.

- **Resolution of Effects**: When combat damage is assigned, Questing Beast's ability takes precedence over the prevention effect of Fog. Thus, even though Fog is cast and resolves, it cannot prevent the combat damage dealt by Questing Beast due to the specific wording of its ability.

### 3. The Ruling
Therefore, the damage from Questing Beast does indeed go through, as its ability negates the prevention effect of Fog.

### Sources
[[Questing Beast]], [Rule 701.43d (Combat Damage Prevention)]  
[[Fog]], [Rule 120.4d (Damage Event Occurrence)]",Yes,5,CORRECT,"The Bot's final ruling correctly states that the damage from Questing Beast goes through, aligning with the Ground Truth. It accurately explains that Questing Beast's ability prevents the combat damage from being stopped by Fog, which is the key interaction in this scenario. The logic provided in the preceding sections supports this conclusion, and the Bot's explanation is consistent with the rules of Magic: The Gathering."
3,"If my opponent casts [[Solitude]] on my [[Ketramose]] during my turn, do I draw a card from [[Ketramose]]'s ability?","Yes, you will draw a card. Ketramose's ability is a triggered ability that looks back at the game state to see if its trigger condition was met, and it functions even if Ketramose itself leaves the battlefield as part of the event or before the ability resolves.",hard,"Zones, Objects & State-Based Actions","Ah, the intricacies of triggered abilities and the timing of spell resolutions! Let us delve into the mechanics at play here.

### 1. The Interaction
The key cards in this scenario are **Solitude**, which has a triggered ability that exiles a target creature upon entering the battlefield, and **Ketramose**, which has an ability that allows you to draw a card when it is exiled.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
1. **Casting Solitude**: Your opponent casts **Solitude** during your turn, targeting **Ketramose**. This is a crucial moment, as the timing of abilities is paramount.
   
2. **Resolving Solitude's Ability**: When **Solitude** enters the battlefield, its triggered ability resolves, exiling **Ketramose**. At this point, **Ketramose** is no longer on the battlefield; it has been exiled.

3. **Ketramose's Trigger**: The ability of **Ketramose** that allows you to draw a card triggers when it is exiled. However, it is important to note that this ability is placed on the stack after **Solitude** has resolved. 

4. **Independence of Abilities**: According to the rules, once an ability is activated or triggered, it exists independently of its source. Therefore, even though **Ketramose** is no longer on the battlefield, its triggered ability will still resolve.

5. **Drawing the Card**: Since **Ketramose**'s ability is now on the stack and resolves, you will indeed draw a card as a result of its exile.

### 3. The Ruling
You will draw a card from **Ketramose**'s ability when it is exiled by **Solitude**.

### Sources
[[Solitude]], [Rule 704.4 (State-Based Actions)]  
[[Ketramose]], [Rule 113.7a (The Stack)]",Yes,5,CORRECT,"The Bot's final ruling correctly states that you will draw a card from Ketramose's ability when it is exiled by Solitude. This aligns with the Ground Truth, which confirms that Ketramose's triggered ability functions independently of its presence on the battlefield at the time of resolution. The logic provided in the Bot's answer supports this conclusion, demonstrating a clear understanding of the interaction between the two cards and the relevant rules."
4,I cast [[Dress Down]] and my opponent has a [[Magus of the Moon]] in play. Are my non-basic lands still mountains?,"Yes, your non-basic lands will still be mountains even after casting Dress Down on Magus of the Moon, because Magus's effect (changing land types in Layer 4) applies before Dress Down's effect (removing abilities in Layer 6), meaning the lands become mountains before the Magus loses its ability to do so.",hard,"Continuous Effects, Layers & Copying","Ah, the intricate dance of enchantments and creatures! Let us delve into the mechanics at play here.

### 1. The Interaction
The key cards in this scenario are **Dress Down**, which causes creatures to lose all abilities, and **Magus of the Moon**, which turns nonbasic lands into Mountains.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- When **Dress Down** enters the battlefield, it triggers its ability, causing all creatures to lose their abilities. This includes **Magus of the Moon**, which will lose its ability to turn nonbasic lands into Mountains.
- However, it is crucial to note that the effect of **Magus of the Moon** is a type-changing effect that applies to nonbasic lands. According to the rules, this effect is applied before considering the removal of abilities. Thus, while **Magus of the Moon** loses its abilities due to **Dress Down**, the effect that has already turned nonbasic lands into Mountains remains in effect.
- Therefore, your nonbasic lands will still be Mountains, as they have already gained that subtype from **Magus of the Moon** before it lost its abilities.

### 3. The Ruling
Your nonbasic lands remain Mountains even after casting **Dress Down**, as the type-changing effect of **Magus of the Moon** persists despite its loss of abilities.

### Sources
[[Dress Down]], [Rule 613 (Layer 4)]  
[[Magus of the Moon]], [Rule 613 (Layer 4)]",Yes,5,CORRECT,"The Bot's final ruling correctly states that the nonbasic lands remain Mountains after casting Dress Down, aligning with the Ground Truth. The logic provided in section 2 accurately explains the interaction between Dress Down and Magus of the Moon, citing the correct application of layers in the rules. The ruling is technically sound and reflects the correct understanding of the card interactions."
5,"If I cast [[Merfolk Trickster]] on [[Dryad of the Ilysian Grove]], will my opponent's [[Valakut]] see his lands as mountains?","Yes, the lands remain Mountains. This happens because type-changing effects are applied in Layer 4, whereas ability-removing effects occur later in Layer 6. Since the game applies the ""Mountain"" type before removing the Dryad's text, Valakut triggers will still function normally. However, the opponent does lose the specific permission to play an additional land for that turn.",hard,"Continuous Effects, Layers & Copying","Ah, a most intriguing inquiry regarding the interaction of abilities and types! Let us delve into the mechanics at play here.

### 1. The Interaction
You are casting **Merfolk Trickster** targeting **Dryad of the Ilysian Grove**. The key conflict arises from the Trickster's ability, which causes the Dryad to lose all abilities until the end of turn, and the Dryad's effect that grants lands the ability to be every basic land type.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Step 1: Casting Merfolk Trickster**: When you cast **Merfolk Trickster**, it enters the battlefield and its ability triggers, targeting **Dryad of the Ilysian Grove**. This ability will resolve and tap the Dryad, causing it to lose all abilities until the end of turn.
  
- **Step 2: Dryad's Abilities**: The Dryad has the ability that states ""Lands you control are every basic land type in addition to their other types."" This ability is a Layer 6 effect, meaning it is retained even after the Trickster's ability resolves. 

- **Step 3: Type Change**: The Trickster's effect is a Layer 4 effect, which means it removes all abilities from the Dryad. However, it does not affect the lands that the Dryad has already granted basic land types to. The Dryad itself loses its abilities, but the lands it has affected retain their new types.

- **Step 4: Valakut's Ability**: Now, regarding **Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle**, it has an ability that triggers when a Mountain enters the battlefield. Since the Dryad's effect has made your opponent's lands all basic land types, they are indeed considered Mountains as well. Therefore, Valakut will see those lands as Mountains.

### 3. The Ruling
Thus, your opponent's **Valakut** will indeed see his lands as Mountains, even after the **Merfolk Trickster** has caused the **Dryad of the Ilysian Grove** to lose its abilities.

### Sources

The Bot accurately explains the interaction of abilities and types, correctly identifying that the Dryad's effect (which grants lands the Mountain type) is applied before the Merfolk Trickster's ability removes the Dryad's abilities. The logic provided in the steps supports the ruling, and the Bot's answer is technically sound and well-reasoned."
6,"If I have an [[Urza's Saga]] on chapter II and my opponent plays a [[Blood Moon]], what happens to my [[Urza's Saga]]?","When your opponent plays Blood Moon while your Urza's Saga is on Chapter II, Urza's Saga becomes a basic Mountain, but thanks to a recent rules update (around May 2025), it doesn't get sacrificed, and it retains the abilities from previous chapters, allowing you to keep creating Construct tokens and tapping for mana, effectively becoming a powerful utility Mountain. It loses its lore counters and won't gain more, but its existing chapter abilities become usable on the Mountain.",hard,"Continuous Effects, Layers & Copying","Ah, the intricate dance of enchantments and lands! Let us delve into the mechanics at play here.

### 1. The Interaction
We have two key cards: **Urza's Saga**, which is currently on Chapter II, and **Blood Moon**, which transforms nonbasic lands into Mountains. The conflict arises from Blood Moon's effect on Urza's Saga's abilities.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Step 1: Blood Moon's Effect**: When Blood Moon enters the battlefield, it applies its effect to Urza's Saga, a nonbasic land. According to the rules, this means Urza's Saga loses all of its printed abilities and becomes a Mountain. This is a Layer 4 effect, which wipes the abilities in the printed text box.
  
- **Step 2: Ability Retention**: However, we must observe that Urza's Saga had already gained abilities from its first and second chapters. These abilities are retained because they were gained through a previous effect, which falls under Layer 6. Thus, even though it is now a Mountain, it still retains the abilities to tap for {C} and to create a 0/0 Construct token.

- **Step 3: Lore Counters and Sacrifice Check**: At this point, we must consider the conditions for sacrificing Urza's Saga. It has a lore counter count of 2 (from being on Chapter II) and its final chapter number is 3. According to the rules, a Saga is sacrificed only if the number of lore counters is greater than or equal to its final chapter number and it has one or more chapter abilities. Here, while it has 2 lore counters, it does indeed have retained chapter abilities from its previous chapters.

- **Step 4: The Sacrifice Condition**: Since Urza's Saga has 2 lore counters (less than 3) and retains its chapter abilities, it does not meet the conditions for sacrifice. Therefore, it remains on the battlefield.

### 3. The Ruling
Urza's Saga remains on the battlefield with its retained abilities, as it does not meet the conditions for sacrifice due to having fewer lore counters than its final chapter number.

### Sources

7,"I cast a [[Dragonhawk, Fate's Tempest]] exiling 2 cards, but my opponent kills it right away with [[Shoot the Sheriff]]. On my end step, I still have the 2 cards in exile. Does the [[Dragonhawk]] still do damage to my opponent even if it is in the graveyard?","Yes, the Dragonhawk's end-step ability will still trigger and deal 4 damage to your opponent, even though it died, because the ability creates a delayed trigger that exists independently on the stack, separate from its source. The key is that the ability triggered and put the cards into exile and the damage effect on the stack; as long as the cards are still in exile, the delayed trigger resolves and deals damage based on those specific exiled cards.",hard,"The Stack, Timing & Priority","Ah, a fascinating inquiry into the nuances of delayed triggered abilities and the independence of sources! 

### 1. The Interaction
You have cast **Dragonhawk, Fate's Tempest**, which exiled 2 cards from your library. Your opponent then responded by casting **Shoot the Sheriff**, destroying the Dragonhawk. The question at hand is whether the Dragonhawk's delayed triggered ability will still deal damage to your opponent at the end of your turn, despite the Dragonhawk being in the graveyard.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- When **Dragonhawk** enters the battlefield, it triggers its ability to exile the top 2 cards of your library. This ability creates a delayed triggered ability that will activate at the beginning of your next end step.
- Your opponent casts **Shoot the Sheriff**, targeting and destroying **Dragonhawk**. However, it is crucial to note that the delayed triggered ability created by Dragonhawk's last ability exists independently of its source once it is placed on the stack (Rule 113.7a).
- The delayed triggered ability will check the number of cards exiled by the Dragonhawk's ability when it resolves, not the current state of the Dragonhawk itself. Since you still have 2 cards exiled from the initial resolution of Dragonhawk's ability, the delayed triggered ability will resolve and deal damage.
- Specifically, the ability states that at the beginning of your next end step, Dragonhawk deals 2 damage to each opponent for each of those cards that are still exiled. Since the cards remain exiled, the ability will resolve as intended.

### 3. The Ruling
Yes, the Dragonhawk will still deal 4 damage to your opponent at the beginning of your end step, despite being in the graveyard.

### Sources
[[Dragonhawk, Fate's Tempest]], [Rule 113.7a (The Stack)]",Yes,5,CORRECT,"The Bot's final ruling in section 3 correctly states that the Dragonhawk will still deal 4 damage to the opponent at the beginning of the end step, despite being in the graveyard.

The logic provided in section 2 supports this ruling, referencing the relevant rule about delayed triggers (Rule 113.7a)."
8,"If my opponent controls [[The One Ring]] with 2 counters and activates it, and I exile it in response with [[Tear Asunder]], does my opponent draw 2 cards, 3 cards, or 0 cards?","Your opponent draws 2 cards. This happens because activated abilities exist independently of their source once placed on the stack; removing The One Ring does not counter the ability. Although a new burden counter cannot be added to the now-exiled card, the game uses Last Known Information to recall the two counters present when it left the battlefield, allowing the draw effect to resolve based on that count.",hard,"The Stack, Timing & Priority","Ah, the intricacies of the stack and the interplay of abilities! Let us dissect this scenario with the precision it deserves.

### 1. The Interaction
The key cards in this interaction are **The One Ring**, which has the ability to draw cards based on the number of burden counters it has, and **Tear Asunder**, which is used to exile The One Ring in response to its activation.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
1. **Activation of The One Ring**: Your opponent activates the ability of The One Ring, which states: ""Put a burden counter on The One Ring, then draw a card for each burden counter on The One Ring."" At this moment, The One Ring has 2 burden counters.

2. **Response with Tear Asunder**: You respond by casting Tear Asunder, targeting The One Ring. Since Tear Asunder is an instant, it goes on the stack above the ability of The One Ring.

3. **Resolution of Tear Asunder**: When Tear Asunder resolves, it successfully exiles The One Ring. Importantly, this action removes The One Ring from the battlefield before the ability can resolve.

4. **Last Known Information (LKI)**: Now, as the ability of The One Ring attempts to resolve, it looks for the number of burden counters on it. However, The One Ring is no longer on the battlefield. According to the rules regarding LKI, we refer to the state of The One Ring immediately before it left the battlefield. At that time, it had 2 burden counters.

5. **Drawing Cards**: The ability states to draw a card for each burden counter. Since there were 2 burden counters before it was exiled, the ability will resolve as if The One Ring still had those counters, allowing your opponent to draw 2 cards.

### 3. The Ruling
Your opponent will draw **2 cards** as a result of the ability resolving, despite The One Ring being exiled.

The rules cited support the ruling, confirming the accuracy of the Bot's response."
9,"If I cast [[Phantasmal Image]] on an activated [[Mutavault]], do I get a 2/2 creature that does not need activation?","No, when Phantasmal Image copies an activated Mutavault (one that's already a creature), the Image enters as a Land, not a creature, because the animation is an effect, not a copyable characteristic. It will only become a 2/2 creature and gain summoning sickness if you activate its ability after it enters, making it a land-creature that must wait until your next turn to tap for mana.",hard,"Continuous Effects, Layers & Copying","Ah, the intricacies of copying and animating creatures! Let us delve into the mechanics at play here.

### 1. The Interaction
You are casting **Phantasmal Image** targeting an activated **Mutavault**. The key conflict arises from the nature of the copy effect and the state of the Mutavault at the time of copying.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Step 1: Activation of Mutavault**: When you activate Mutavault by paying {1}, it becomes a 2/2 creature with all creature types until end of turn. This means it is currently a creature on the battlefield.
  
- **Step 2: Entering the Battlefield**: When **Phantasmal Image** enters the battlefield, it copies the Mutavault. According to the rules, Phantasmal Image will copy the characteristics of the Mutavault as it exists at that moment, which includes its power, toughness, and any abilities it has.

- **Step 3: Copying Abilities**: Importantly, Phantasmal Image will gain the Illusion creature type and the triggered ability that states, ""When this creature becomes the target of a spell or ability, sacrifice it."" However, it does not gain the ability to activate itself as a creature, since it is not a land but a creature copy of Mutavault.

- **Step 4: Independence of Abilities**: The ability of Mutavault to become a creature is an activated ability that requires a cost to be paid. Once Phantasmal Image enters as a copy of Mutavault, it does not have the ability to activate itself to become a creature again, as it is already a creature. 

- **Step 5: Summoning Sickness**: Since Phantasmal Image is a newly entered creature, it will have summoning sickness and cannot attack or activate abilities that require tapping until your next turn.

### 3. The Ruling
You will indeed get a 2/2 creature that does not need activation, as Phantasmal Image enters as a copy of the activated Mutavault, but it cannot activate any abilities until your next turn due to summoning sickness.

10,Can I pay life to [[Bolas's Citadel]] and go to negative life if I have a [[Platinum Angel]]?,"No, you cannot pay life to Bolas's Citadel and go to negative life with Platinum Angel out, because you can't pay life you don't have, even if the Angel keeps you in the game; you can only pay down to 0 life and then can't pay any more, though you can still pay 0 life to activate abilities if a cost allows it. Platinum Angel prevents you from losing the game at 0 or less life, but it doesn't change the fundamental rule that you can't spend life as a resource if your total is zero or below.",hard,"Costs, Mana & Casting Requirements","Ah, the intersection of life totals and game mechanics presents a fascinating conundrum!

### 1. The Interaction
We are examining the interaction between **Platinum Angel**, which prevents you from losing the game, and **Bolas's Citadel**, which allows you to pay life as a cost for casting spells from the top of your library.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Platinum Angel's Effect**: This card states that you cannot lose the game, regardless of your life total. This includes situations where you might have 0 or less life.
- **Bolas's Citadel's Life Payment**: When you activate Bolas's Citadel's ability to cast spells from the top of your library, you may pay life equal to the mana value of the spell instead of its mana cost. According to Rule 119.4, if a cost allows a player to pay an amount of life greater than 0, they may do so only if their life total is greater than or equal to that amount. However, Rule 119.4b states that players can always pay 0 life, regardless of their life total.
- **Negative Life Totals**: While you can pay life to cast spells, if your life total is 0 or less, you cannot pay any life greater than 0. However, since Platinum Angel prevents you from losing the game, you can still be in a state of negative life without losing the game.

Crucially, if you attempt to pay life while at a negative life total, you can only pay 0 life. Thus, you cannot go to negative life through the act of paying life for Bolas's Citadel's ability, as you would be unable to pay any positive amount of life.

### 3. The Ruling
You cannot pay life to Bolas's Citadel if you are at a negative life total, as you can only pay 0 life, but you will not lose the game while controlling Platinum Angel.

11,Do I draw from [[Dark Confidant]] if my life would go to negative but I have a [[Platinum Angel]] out?,"Yes, you still draw from Dark Confidant even if your life goes negative with Platinum Angel out, because the Angel prevents you from losing the game, but doesn't stop your life total from becoming negative; the loss prevention only applies when state-based actions check for a loss, and you can't pay life if you have none to pay, but damage still reduces your life below zero, and Dark Confidant's effect triggers before you'd lose.",hard,"Zones, Objects & State-Based Actions","Ah, the intricate dance of life totals and card draw mechanics! Let us delve into the specifics of this interaction.

### 1. The Interaction
The key cards in question are **Dark Confidant**, which allows you to draw a card and lose life equal to its mana value, and **Platinum Angel**, which prevents you from losing the game. The conflict arises when the life loss from Dark Confidant would potentially reduce your life total to a negative value.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
1. **Dark Confidant's Trigger**: At the beginning of your upkeep, Dark Confidant's ability triggers, allowing you to reveal the top card of your library and put it into your hand. You then lose life equal to the mana value of that card.
   
2. **Life Loss Calculation**: If the revealed card has a mana value that would reduce your life total to a negative number, we must consider the implications of that loss. According to Rule 107.1b, while calculations can yield negative values, the game does not allow life totals to be negative. Instead, if a calculation would result in a negative life total, it is treated as zero.

3. **Platinum Angel's Effect**: Platinum Angel states that you cannot lose the game. However, it does not prevent you from losing life; it merely ensures that you do not lose the game as a result of your life total reaching zero or below. Therefore, if Dark Confidant's ability would cause you to lose life, you would still lose that life, but you would not lose the game due to Platinum Angel's presence.

4. **State-Based Actions**: If your life total were to drop to zero as a result of Dark Confidant's ability, you would not lose the game because Platinum Angel is in play. However, you would still draw the card and lose the life as dictated by Dark Confidant's ability.

### 3. The Ruling
You do draw from Dark Confidant, and you lose life equal to the mana value of the revealed card, but you do not lose the game due to Platinum Angel's effect.

### Sources

The logic provided supports this ruling and correctly references the relevant rules."
12,"If I discarded a nonland card to [[Grab the Prize]] and managed to copy the spell, does the copy also deal the 2 damage?","Yes, the copied Grab the Prize will deal 2 damage to each opponent because copies of spells copy all choices made for the original, including additional costs, so the copy ""remembers"" that a nonland was discarded for the original spell and applies that effect. You don't pay additional costs for the copy, but it references the original's costs to determine its own outcome.",hard,"Costs, Mana & Casting Requirements","Ah, the intricacies of spell copying and damage resolution! Let us delve into the mechanics at play here.

### 1. The Interaction
The key card in question is **Grab the Prize**, a sorcery that allows you to discard a card as an additional cost to cast it, draw two cards, and potentially deal 2 damage to each opponent if the discarded card was not a land. The query revolves around whether a copy of this spell, created after discarding a nonland card, will also deal the 2 damage.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Casting Grab the Prize**: When you cast **Grab the Prize**, you must first discard a card. If this card is a nonland, you will draw two cards and deal 2 damage to each opponent.
- **Copying the Spell**: When a copy of **Grab the Prize** is created, it retains the characteristics of the original spell, including the decisions made for it. This means that the copy will also reference the same discarded card used to pay the cost of the original spell.
- **Damage Calculation**: Since the original spell was cast with a nonland card discarded, the copy will also deal 2 damage to each opponent. This is because the copy of the spell uses the same information regarding the discarded card as the original spell did.

Crucially, the rules state that a copy of a spell retains all decisions made for the original spell, including the additional cost of discarding a card. Therefore, the copy will also check if the discarded card was a land or not, and since it was a nonland, the damage will indeed be dealt.

### 3. The Ruling
Yes, the copy of **Grab the Prize** will also deal 2 damage to each opponent, as it references the same discarded nonland card used for the original spell.

13,"If I have an active [[Purphoros, God of the Forge]] enchanted by [[Unable to Scream]], what happens if my devotion drops below 5? Does the aura fall? Is [[Purphoros]] still a Toy creature?","Purphoros remains a Toy creature, and the Aura does not fall off. This happens because both effects (Purphoros trying to revert to a non-creature enchantment and the Aura forcing him to be a Toy creature) apply in Layer 4. Since the Aura entered the battlefield later, its timestamp wins the conflict and overwrites Purphoros's natural state. Because the Aura successfully forces him to remain a creature, it stays legally attached to him regardless of your current devotion count.",hard,"Continuous Effects, Layers & Copying","Ah, the intricacies of enchantments and devotion! Let us delve into this fascinating interaction.

### 1. The Interaction
We have two key cards at play: **Purphoros, God of the Forge**, which is an indestructible legendary enchantment creature, and **Unable to Scream**, an Aura that enchants Purphoros. The crux of the matter lies in the relationship between Purphoros's devotion and the effects of Unable to Scream.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
1. **Devotion Calculation**: Purphoros's status as a creature is contingent upon your devotion to red being 5 or greater. If your devotion drops below 5, Purphoros ceases to be a creature. This is a crucial point, as it directly affects the interaction with Unable to Scream.

2. **Effect of Unable to Scream**: When Unable to Scream enchants Purphoros, it causes Purphoros to lose all abilities and become a Toy artifact creature with base power and toughness of 0/2. This effect is applied immediately upon the Aura resolving.

3. **Transitioning Out of Creature Status**: If your devotion subsequently drops below 5, Purphoros will no longer be a creature. However, the effects of Unable to Scream do not simply vanish. The Aura's effect has already established Purphoros as a Toy creature, and it retains that status even when it is no longer a creature.

4. **Aura's Attachment**: Since Unable to Scream is still legally attached to Purphoros (as it is still an object on the battlefield), it does not fall off simply because Purphoros is no longer a creature. The Aura remains attached, and Purphoros continues to be a Toy artifact creature.

5. **Independence of Abilities**: Importantly, the ability of Purphoros that causes it to stop being a creature is still in effect, but it does not negate the effects of Unable to Scream. Thus, Purphoros retains the Toy creature status while being an enchantment.

### 3. The Ruling
If your devotion to red drops below 5, Purphoros, God of the Forge, will no longer be a creature, but it will still be enchanted by Unable to Scream, remaining a Toy artifact creature with base power and toughness of 0/2.

14,"I have a [[Utopia Sprawl]] enchanting a [[Breeding Pool]], and play a [[Harbinger of the Seas]]; does the [[Utopia Sprawl]] stay on the land, or fall off?","When you play Harbinger of the Seas, it turns your enchanted Breeding Pool into an Island, making it no longer a Forest, so Utopia Sprawl falls off and goes to the graveyard because its enchantment condition (enchanting a Forest) is no longer met. Sprawl is picky and needs a Forest; when that land stops being a Forest (due to Harbinger, Blood Moon, or Spreading Seas), the Sprawl loses its target and ceases to exist.",hard,"Continuous Effects, Layers & Copying","Ah, a delightful inquiry into the intricate dance of enchantments and land types! Let us dissect this interaction with precision.

### 1. The Interaction
We have a Utopia Sprawl enchanting a Breeding Pool, and then a Harbinger of the Seas is played. The crux of the matter lies in how Harbinger of the Seas affects the Breeding Pool and, consequently, the Utopia Sprawl.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Step 1: Utopia Sprawl's Effect**: Utopia Sprawl enchants the Breeding Pool, allowing it to produce an additional mana of a chosen color when tapped. At this point, the Breeding Pool retains its original characteristics as a Forest Island.
  
- **Step 2: Harbinger of the Seas Enters**: When Harbinger of the Seas enters the battlefield, it applies its effect, which states that nonbasic lands become Islands. This is a type-changing effect that occurs in Layer 4.

- **Step 3: Layer Application**: According to the rules, when Harbinger of the Seas applies its effect, it changes the Breeding Pool to an Island. However, crucially, this type change does not remove the Utopia Sprawl. The enchantment remains on the land because the Utopia Sprawl was already attached to the Breeding Pool before the Harbinger's effect took place.

- **Step 4: Continuous Effects**: The Utopia Sprawl continues to function as it was originally intended, because the enchantment does not lose its ability to enchant the land simply because the land's type has changed. The Utopia Sprawl will still provide the additional mana of the chosen color when the Breeding Pool is tapped.

The mana value (formerly converted mana cost or CMC) of the spell is calculated using that chosen value for X; in this case it would be 4.",hard,"The Stack, Timing & Priority","Ah, the intricacies of mana costs and counters! Let us delve into this interaction with precision.

### 1. The Interaction
We have a **Chalice of the Void** with 0 charge counters on it and an opponent casting a **Walking Ballista** by paying 4 mana.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Chalice of the Void** has an ability that triggers when a player casts a spell with a mana value equal to the number of charge counters on it. Since there are 0 charge counters, it will counter any spell with a mana value of 0.
- The **Walking Ballista** is cast with a mana cost of {X}{X}, where X is 2 (since they paid 4 mana). Thus, the mana value of **Walking Ballista** on the stack is 4, as the total cost is calculated as 2 + 2.
- Since the mana value of **Walking Ballista** (4) does not equal the number of charge counters on **Chalice of the Void** (0), the ability of **Chalice of the Void** does not trigger. Therefore, the **Walking Ballista** is not countered.

### 3. The Ruling
The **Walking Ballista** is not countered, and its converted mana cost (CMC) on the stack is 4.

16,I cast [[Taunting Elf]] and have a [[Jaspera Sentinel]] in play. Can I use the Sentinel to tap the Elf for mana right away? Or the Elf's summoning sickness prevents me from that?,"Yes, you can use the Jaspera Sentinel to tap the Taunting Elf for mana right away. Summoning sickness only prevents a creature from attacking or using its OWN abilities if they involve the tap symbol or the untap symbol as a cost",hard,"Costs, Mana & Casting Requirements","Ah, the intricacies of summoning sickness and activated abilities! Let us delve into this interaction with clarity.

### 1. The Interaction
You have cast **Taunting Elf**, a creature that has just entered the battlefield, and you wish to use **Jaspera Sentinel** to tap the Elf for mana. The crux of the matter lies in the summoning sickness rule and the conditions under which activated abilities can be used.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Summoning Sickness**: According to Rule 302.6, a creature cannot activate abilities that include the tap symbol unless it has been under its controller's control continuously since the beginning of their most recent turn. Since **Taunting Elf** has just entered the battlefield, it has not been under your control since the beginning of your turn, and thus it is affected by summoning sickness.
  
- **Jaspera Sentinel's Ability**: The ability of **Jaspera Sentinel** requires you to tap an untapped creature you control. However, since **Taunting Elf** is currently unable to tap for mana due to summoning sickness, it cannot be tapped as a cost for the Sentinel's ability.

- **Independence of Abilities**: It is important to note that while **Jaspera Sentinel** can tap itself to produce mana, it cannot tap **Taunting Elf** because the Elf is not eligible to be tapped for this purpose.

### 3. The Ruling
You cannot use **Jaspera Sentinel** to tap **Taunting Elf** for mana right away, as the Elf is affected by summoning sickness and cannot be tapped.

17,"If I cast [[Seasoned Pyromancer]] with an exerted [[Arena of Glory]], creating 2 elemental tokens, do the tokens have haste too?","No, the tokens do not have haste.

### 1. The Interaction
We have two key cards at play: **Arena of Glory**, which has an exert ability that grants haste to creature spells cast with its mana, and **Seasoned Pyromancer**, which creates 1/1 red Elemental creature tokens upon entering the battlefield.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
1. **Casting Seasoned Pyromancer**: You cast Seasoned Pyromancer using mana generated from an exerted Arena of Glory. The exerted Arena of Glory allows you to add {R}{R} and grants haste to any creature spell cast with that mana.
   
2. **Token Creation**: Upon entering the battlefield, Seasoned Pyromancer's ability resolves, allowing you to discard two cards and draw two cards. For each nonland card discarded, you create a 1/1 red Elemental token. In this case, you create two tokens.

3. **Haste Application**: The crucial point here is that the tokens created by Seasoned Pyromancer do not inherently gain haste. The ability from Arena of Glory only grants haste to the creature spell (Seasoned Pyromancer) itself, not to the tokens created as a result of its ability. 

4. **Understanding Haste**: Haste is a static ability that applies to the creature that has it. The tokens created are not the result of a spell cast with haste; they are simply created as a result of Seasoned Pyromancer's ability. Therefore, they do not gain haste.

### 3. The Ruling

### 1. The Interaction
You are casting **Treachery** on your opponent's **Eidolon of Blossoms**. The key elements to consider are the triggered ability of Eidolon of Blossoms and the effect of Treachery.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- When **Treachery** enters the battlefield, it triggers its own ability, which allows you to untap up to five lands. This is a separate action from the interaction with Eidolon of Blossoms.
- Crucially, **Treachery** enchants the Eidolon of Blossoms, meaning you now control it. 
- The moment **Eidolon of Blossoms** enters the battlefield, its constellation ability triggers. This ability states that whenever an enchantment enters the battlefield under your control, you draw a card.
- Since **Treachery** is an enchantment and you now control the Eidolon of Blossoms, the constellation ability will indeed trigger, allowing you to draw a card.

### 3. The Ruling
Yes, you will draw a card when you cast **Treachery** on your opponent's **Eidolon of Blossoms** due to the constellation ability triggering as a result of Treachery entering the battlefield.

19,"If I cast [[Ephemerate]] on my [[Master of Waves]] with 4 Elemental tokens out, do the tokens die?","No, the tokens do not die. This happens because State-Based Actions (which check for creatures with 0 toughness) are not performed in the middle of a resolving spell.

By the time the spell finishes resolving and the game actually checks the board state, the Master is back and the tokens are safe with the bonus reapplied.",hard,"Zones, Objects & State-Based Actions","Ah, a most intriguing inquiry regarding the interaction of spells and permanents! Let us delve into the mechanics at play here.

### 1. The Interaction
You are casting **Ephemerate** on **Master of Waves**, which currently has 4 Elemental tokens created from its ability. The key conflict arises from the nature of the tokens and the effects of **Ephemerate**.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Step 1: Casting Ephemerate**: When you cast **Ephemerate**, it targets **Master of Waves**. Upon resolution, **Ephemerate** will exile **Master of Waves** and return it to the battlefield.
  
- **Step 2: Exiling Master of Waves**: As **Master of Waves** is exiled, it ceases to exist in its current form. Consequently, the Elemental tokens it created are dependent on its presence on the battlefield. 

- **Step 3: Elemental Tokens' Fate**: According to the official rulings regarding **Master of Waves**, if it leaves the battlefield, the Elemental tokens created by it will have a toughness of 0 (since they are 1/0 creatures). Thus, they will die immediately upon the departure of **Master of Waves**.

- **Step 4: Returning Master of Waves**: When **Master of Waves** returns to the battlefield, it is treated as a new object. However, the tokens have already ceased to exist due to their 0 toughness when **Master of Waves** was exiled.

### 1. The Interaction
You are considering the interaction between **Clone**, which can enter as a copy of any creature on the battlefield, and **Lignify**, which enchants a creature, turning it into a Treefolk with base power and toughness of 0/4 while stripping it of all abilities.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Step 1: Lignify's Effect**: When a creature is enchanted by Lignify, it loses all its abilities and becomes a Treefolk with base stats of 0/4. This means that the original creature's characteristics are overwritten by Lignify's effect.
  
- **Step 2: Clone's Entry**: When you cast Clone, it will enter the battlefield as a copy of the target creature. However, Clone copies the *printed* characteristics of the original creature, not the modified characteristics due to Lignify. According to Rule 707.2, Clone will copy the original creature's characteristics as they are printed on the card, which includes its name, mana cost, type, and so forth.

- **Step 3: The Nature of Copying**: Importantly, Clone does not copy the current state of the creature affected by Lignify. Instead, it copies the original characteristics of the creature before any modifications were made by Lignify. Thus, if the original creature had abilities or characteristics that were altered by Lignify, those alterations do not affect Clone's copying process.

- **Step 4: Resulting Characteristics**: Therefore, Clone will enter the battlefield as a copy of the original creature, retaining its original power, toughness, and abilities, despite the fact that the original creature is currently a 0/4 Treefolk due to Lignify.

21,"If [[Phantasmal Image]] is copying a black creature, can I kill it with [[Terror]]?","No, you cannot kill it with Terror. This is because Phantasmal Image copies all characteristics of the original creature, including its color.

Let us delve into the mechanics at play here.

### 1. The Interaction
The key cards in question are Phantasmal Image, which enters the battlefield as a copy of any creature, and Terror, an instant that destroys target nonartifact, nonblack creatures. The conflict arises from the color identity of the creature being copied.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Phantasmal Image's Copying Ability**: When Phantasmal Image enters the battlefield, it can become a copy of any creature on the battlefield. If you choose a black creature, it will copy all of that creature's characteristics, including its color.
- **Terror's Targeting Restrictions**: Terror specifically states that it can only target nonartifact, nonblack creatures. Therefore, if Phantasmal Image is copying a black creature, it will also be black due to the copying process.
- **Application of the Rules**: According to Rule 707.3, when Phantasmal Image copies a creature, it adopts all of its copiable values, including color. Since the original creature is black, the Phantasmal Image will also be black. Consequently, it falls under the restrictions of Terror.

### 3. The Ruling
You cannot target Phantasmal Image with Terror if it is copying a black creature, as it is considered a black creature itself and thus cannot be destroyed by Terror.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Targeting**: Hydroblast can indeed target Phantasmal Bear, as it is a legal target for spells and abilities (Rule 115.2). However, the critical aspect lies in what happens when Hydroblast resolves.
  
- **Triggered Ability**: When Hydroblast targets Phantasmal Bear, the bear's ability triggers and goes on the stack. This ability states that if it becomes the target of a spell or ability, it must be sacrificed. Thus, the ability will resolve first, causing Phantasmal Bear to be sacrificed before Hydroblast can resolve.

- **Resolution of Hydroblast**: After Phantasmal Bear is sacrificed, it is no longer on the battlefield. Hydroblast will then attempt to resolve. However, since Hydroblast's effect to destroy a permanent requires a legal target, and Phantasmal Bear is no longer there, Hydroblast will not be able to destroy it. Instead, it will be countered due to having no legal targets remaining (Rule 608.2b).

### 1. The Interaction
The key cards in this scenario are **Wasteland Strangler** and **Phantasmal Bear**. The conflict arises from Wasteland Strangler's ability, which requires a card in exile to function, and the targeting of Phantasmal Bear.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Wasteland Strangler's Ability**: When Wasteland Strangler enters the battlefield, its ability allows you to put a card an opponent owns from exile into their graveyard. If you do so, you may then target a creature to give it -3/-3 until end of turn.
- **Requirement for the Ability**: Crucially, for Wasteland Strangler's ability to resolve successfully, you must have a card in exile to choose from. If your opponent has no cards in exile, you cannot fulfill the requirement of the ability.
- **Targeting Phantasmal Bear**: If you attempt to cast Wasteland Strangler while your opponent has no cards in exile, you will not be able to activate its ability. Therefore, you cannot target Phantasmal Bear with the -3/-3 effect because the first part of the ability (putting a card from exile into the graveyard) cannot be completed.

1. **Tidehollow Sculler Enters**: When Tidehollow Sculler enters the battlefield, its ability triggers, prompting you to choose a nonland card from your opponent's hand to exile. However, this ability is still on the stack and has not yet resolved.

2. **Casting Cloudshift**: You then cast Cloudshift in response to the Sculler's triggered ability. Cloudshift exiles Tidehollow Sculler and returns it to the battlefield. Importantly, when it returns, it is treated as a new object with no relation to the original Tidehollow Sculler.

3. **Resolution of Cloudshift**: Upon resolution, Tidehollow Sculler is exiled and then returned to the battlefield. As a new object, it does not retain any counters, Auras, or attachments from its previous existence. 

4. **Triggered Ability of Tidehollow Sculler**: Now, we must consider the original triggered ability of Tidehollow Sculler. Since it has left the battlefield due to Cloudshift before its ability resolved, that ability is still on the stack. However, because Tidehollow Sculler is now a new object, it does not have any knowledge of the previous state, and thus, the ability that would have exiled a card from your opponent's hand does not resolve. 

5. **Final Outcome**: The original ability of Tidehollow Sculler does nothing when it resolves because the Sculler that triggered it is no longer on the battlefield.

Tidehollow Sculler enters the battlefield, its ability triggers, but upon casting Cloudshift in response, it is exiled and returned as a new object, causing the original ability to resolve without effect.

25,Can I activate my [[Spellskite]] in response to my opponent trying to equip his creature with [[Shadowspear]]? Will the [[Shadowspear]] equip [[Spellskite]] instead?,"You can activate Spellskite, but the redirection will fail. This happens because the **Equip** keyword specifically targets a creature **controlled by the player activating the ability**. Since your opponent controls the equip ability but does not control your Spellskite, your creature is an illegal target for that specific ability. The target remains unchanged, and the Shadowspear will attach to the opponent's creature as originally intended.",hard,"The Stack, Timing & Priority","Ah, the intricacies of targeting and equipment! Let us delve into this interaction with the precision it deserves.

### 1. The Interaction
The key cards in question are **Spellskite**, which has the ability to change the target of a spell or ability, and **Shadowspear**, which has an equip ability that targets a creature. The mechanical conflict arises from whether Spellskite can successfully change the target of Shadowspear's equip ability.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Step 1: Activation of Shadowspear's Equip Ability**: When your opponent activates Shadowspear's equip ability, they choose a target creature to equip. This ability is placed on the stack.
  
- **Step 2: Responding with Spellskite**: You may activate Spellskite's ability in response to the equip ability. This ability allows you to change the target of the equip ability to Spellskite itself.

- **Step 3: Targeting Rules**: Observe that Shadowspear's equip ability targets a creature. If you successfully activate Spellskite's ability, you can change the target of that equip ability to Spellskite. However, for this to be successful, Spellskite must be a legal target at the time the ability resolves.

- **Step 4: Legal Target Check**: If Spellskite is still on the battlefield and is a legal target when Shadowspear's equip ability resolves, then it will indeed be equipped with Shadowspear. If, however, Spellskite is no longer a legal target (for instance, if it has been removed from the battlefield before the equip ability resolves), then the target cannot be changed, and Shadowspear will not equip Spellskite.

### 3. The Ruling
You can activate Spellskite in response to your opponent trying to equip their creature with Shadowspear, and if Spellskite remains a legal target when the equip ability resolves, it will be equipped with Shadowspear.

### Sources

The Bot's answer does not align with this critical aspect of the rules."
26,"If my opponent cast a [[Fatal Push]] on my creature, can I use [[Aether Vial]] in response to put [[Unsettled Mariner]] into play and force him to pay 1 more mana?","No, the opponent does not have to pay. This happens because Unsettled Mariner triggers only at the specific moment a permanent becomes the target of a spell. By the time you receive priority to activate Aether Vial, Fatal Push has already been cast and the target established. Since the Mariner arrives on the battlefield after the targeting event has already finished, its ability effectively missed the moment to trigger.",hard,"The Stack, Timing & Priority","Ah, the intricacies of timing and the stack! Let us delve into this interaction with precision.

### 1. The Interaction
The key cards in this scenario are **Aether Vial**, which allows you to put a creature onto the battlefield, and **Fatal Push**, which targets and potentially destroys your creature. The creature you wish to put onto the battlefield is **Unsettled Mariner**, which has an ability that can counter spells unless its controller pays {1}.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
1. Your opponent casts **Fatal Push**, targeting your creature. This spell goes onto the stack, and you have the opportunity to respond before it resolves.
2. You activate **Aether Vial** in response, using its ability to put **Unsettled Mariner** onto the battlefield. This is a crucial moment: the ability of Aether Vial does not go on the stack; it resolves immediately, and Unsettled Mariner enters the battlefield.
3. Now, observe that Unsettled Mariner's ability triggers because it has entered the battlefield and your opponent's **Fatal Push** is targeting a creature you control. This ability will go on the stack.
4. When the **Fatal Push** resolves, it checks the target creature's mana value. If it is 2 or less, it will destroy that creature. However, because Unsettled Mariner is now on the battlefield, your opponent must pay {1} to avoid having Fatal Push resolved against their target.
5. If your opponent does not pay the additional {1} mana, the **Fatal Push** will resolve and destroy the targeted creature.

### 3. The Ruling
Yes, you can use **Aether Vial** in response to **Fatal Push** to put **Unsettled Mariner** onto the battlefield, thereby forcing your opponent to pay {1} more mana to resolve their spell.

This is incorrect because Unsettled Mariner's ability only triggers when it enters the battlefield and does not affect the targeting of Fatal Push, which has already occurred. The Ground Truth correctly states that the opponent does not have to pay the additional mana, as the targeting event has already completed before Unsettled Mariner enters the battlefield."
27,"I cast [[Supernatural Stamina]] on [[Elenda, the Dusk Rose]] in response to a board wipe. When she dies and returns, does she get counters from the other creatures dying? Does the token generation count the +2/+0 buff?","You create tokens based on her buffed power, but the returned Elenda receives no counters. This happens because the token generation relies on Last Known Information to check her power (including the +2/+0) at the moment of death. However, the Elenda that returns is a completely new object; she arrives after the board wipe is complete, so she effectively missed the event of the other creatures dying.",hard,"Zones, Objects & State-Based Actions","Ah, the intricacies of triggered abilities and state-based actions! Let us delve into the mechanics at play here.

### 1. The Interaction
You have cast **Supernatural Stamina** on **Elenda, the Dusk Rose** just before a board wipe occurs. This interaction involves the effects of Supernatural Stamina, which grants Elenda a temporary boost and a triggered ability upon her death, alongside Elenda's own abilities that trigger when other creatures die.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
1. **Supernatural Stamina's Effect**: When you cast Supernatural Stamina on Elenda, she gains +2/+0 and the ability to return to the battlefield tapped if she dies. This effect lasts until the end of the turn.

2. **Board Wipe**: When the board wipe resolves, Elenda dies simultaneously with any other creatures. At this moment, we must consider the state of Elenda and the other creatures.

3. **Triggered Abilities**: Elenda has a triggered ability that states, ""Whenever another creature dies, put a +1/+1 counter on Elenda."" However, since she dies at the same time as the other creatures, her ability will trigger for each of those creatures that die. 

4. **Last Known Information (LKI)**: Crucially, when Elenda dies, her last known power is 3 (1 base + 2 from Supernatural Stamina). Therefore, when her ability resolves, she will receive +1/+1 counters for each other creature that died, based on her power at the time of her death.

5. **Returning to the Battlefield**: After the board wipe, Elenda returns to the battlefield tapped due to the effect of Supernatural Stamina. However, she is considered a new object, and thus her previous counters do not carry over. 

6. **Token Generation**: When Elenda returns, she does not have any +1/+1 counters on her because she is a new object. Therefore, when she dies again, she will not create any tokens based on her power, as it is now 1.

### 3. The Ruling
Elenda will gain +1/+1 counters for each creature that died alongside her, based on her power of 3 at the time of her death, but she will not create any tokens upon her second death since she returns as a new object with a power of 1.

### Sources

28,Can I use the processor ability of [[Oracle of Dust]] when there is a [[Rest in Peace]] in play?,"Yes, you can use the ability. This works because paying a cost only requires you to attempt the specified action, even if a replacement effect changes the final outcome. When you move the opponent's card from exile to the graveyard to pay Oracle's cost, Rest in Peace intercepts it and sends it right back to exile. The game considers the cost paid because the card legally left the exile zone (becoming a new object), even though it ended up returning there immediately, allowing you to draw and discard.",hard,"Zones, Objects & State-Based Actions","Ah, the intricate dance of enchantments and creatures! Let us delve into the mechanics at play here.

### 1. The Interaction
The key cards in question are **Rest in Peace**, which exiles all graveyards and replaces graveyard interactions with exile effects, and **Oracle of Dust**, which has an ability that allows you to put a card from exile into an opponent's graveyard.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
First, we must consider the effect of **Rest in Peace**. When it enters the battlefield, it exiles all graveyards, meaning that any cards that would normally be put into a graveyard from anywhere are instead exiled. This is crucial because it alters the fundamental interaction of graveyard mechanics.

Now, let us examine the ability of **Oracle of Dust**: it allows you to put a card an opponent owns from exile into that player's graveyard. The key here is that the ability of **Oracle of Dust** does not depend on the card being in a graveyard; rather, it requires a card to be in exile.

Observe that **Rest in Peace** does not prevent cards from being exiled; it merely changes the destination of cards that would otherwise go to the graveyard. Therefore, if you have a card in exile that belongs to your opponent, you can indeed activate the ability of **Oracle of Dust** to put that card into their graveyard.

Crucially, the independence of abilities means that once the ability of **Oracle of Dust** is activated, it exists independently of its source. Thus, even if **Rest in Peace** is on the battlefield, it does not interfere with the resolution of **Oracle of Dust**'s ability.

### 3. The Ruling
You may use the processor ability of **Oracle of Dust** to put a card from exile into an opponent's graveyard, even with **Rest in Peace** in play.

### Sources
[[Rest in Peace]], [Rule 704.5s (Saga Mortality Check)]; [[Oracle of Dust]], [Rule 113.7a (The Stack)].",Yes,5,CORRECT,"The Bot's final ruling in section 3 correctly states that you may use the processor ability of Oracle of Dust to put a card from exile into an opponent's graveyard, even with Rest in Peace in play.

The Bot's logic supports this ruling by accurately describing the interaction between the two cards and the mechanics involved."
29,"If I use [[Snapcaster Mage]] to flashback [[Approach of the Second Sun]], where would it go when it resolves?","It will be exiled. This happens because Flashback creates a strict replacement effect: if the spell would leave the stack to go anywhere other than exile, it is exiled instead. Even though Approach of the Second Sun specifically instructs you to put it into your library, the Flashback rule intercepts that movement and forces the card into the exile zone.",hard,"Zones, Objects & State-Based Actions","Ah, a fascinating inquiry into the mechanics of spell resolution and card interactions! Let us delve into the intricacies of this scenario.

### 1. The Interaction
The key cards in question are **Snapcaster Mage**, which allows you to flashback a sorcery from your graveyard, and **Approach of the Second Sun**, a sorcery that has specific rules regarding its resolution and placement in your library.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- When you cast **Snapcaster Mage**, it enters the battlefield and triggers its ability, allowing you to target **Approach of the Second Sun** in your graveyard. You can now cast it from your graveyard by paying its flashback cost of {6}{W}.
- Upon casting **Approach of the Second Sun** using its flashback ability, it is treated as a new object. This is crucial because the rules state that a card that changes zones (from graveyard to stack) is considered a new object. Therefore, it does not count as the first or second casting of **Approach of the Second Sun** for the purposes of its win condition.
- As **Approach of the Second Sun** resolves, it will follow the instructions in its text. Since you are casting it from your graveyard, it will not trigger the win condition because it does not count as having been cast from your hand. Instead, it will instruct you to put it into your library seventh from the top and gain 7 life.
- Finally, after resolving, **Approach of the Second Sun** will be placed into your library, specifically in the position indicated by its effect.

### 3. The Ruling
When **Approach of the Second Sun** is flashed back using **Snapcaster Mage**, it will be placed into your library seventh from the top upon resolution.

### Sources

30,"If a [[Field-Tested Frying Pan]] enters the battlefield while I control [[Peregrin Took]], how many food tokens would I create in total?","You will create three Food tokens and one Halfling token. This happens because Field-Tested Frying Pan generates tokens using two separate instructions: first creating a Food, then creating a Halfling. Peregrin Took's replacement effect sees two distinct token-creation events and applies to each one individually, adding an extra Food to the first event (making two Foods) and an extra Food to the second event (making one Halfling and one Food).",hard,"Zones, Objects & State-Based Actions","Ah, the delightful interplay of token creation and equipment! Let us delve into the mechanics at hand.

### 1. The Interaction
The key cards in this scenario are **Field-Tested Frying Pan**, which creates a Food token and a Halfling creature token upon entering the battlefield, and **Peregrin Took**, whose ability enhances token creation by adding an additional Food token whenever you create tokens.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- When **Field-Tested Frying Pan** enters the battlefield, it triggers its ability to create a Food token and a 1/1 white Halfling creature token.
- According to **Peregrin Took's** ability, whenever you create one or more tokens, you create an additional Food token. This ability applies to all tokens created, including the one from the Frying Pan.
- Therefore, the sequence of events is as follows:
  1. **Field-Tested Frying Pan** creates **1 Food token**.
  2. **Peregrin Took** sees that a token (the Food token) has been created and triggers its ability, resulting in the creation of **1 additional Food token**.
  
Thus, you have created a total of **2 Food tokens**: the original one from the Frying Pan and the additional one from Peregrin Took's ability.

### 3. The Ruling
In total, you would create **2 Food tokens** when **Field-Tested Frying Pan** enters the battlefield while you control **Peregrin Took**.

31,"If I manifest [[Nexus of Fate]] with [[Abhorrent Oculus]] and the manifested creature dies, will [[Nexus of Fate]]'s replacement trigger activate and put it back in library or does it simply hit the graveyard stay there?","It will stay in the graveyard. This happens because face-down creatures have no text or abilities, meaning the replacement effect (shuffle into library) simply does not exist at the moment the creature dies. Since replacement effects must exist before an event occurs to modify it, the game treats it as a vanilla 2/2 dying; by the time the card is revealed in the graveyard, the transition is complete and it is too late to apply the shuffle effect.",hard,"Zones, Objects & State-Based Actions","Ah, a most intriguing inquiry regarding the interaction of replacement effects and manifested permanents! Let us delve into the mechanics at play here.

### 1. The Interaction
We have two key cards: **Nexus of Fate**, which has a replacement effect that shuffles it into its owner's library instead of going to the graveyard, and **Abhorrent Oculus**, which allows you to manifest cards from your library. The question revolves around what happens when the manifested **Nexus of Fate** dies.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Manifesting Nexus of Fate**: When you manifest **Nexus of Fate** using **Abhorrent Oculus**, it enters the battlefield as a face-down 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, or abilities. It is important to note that while it is face down, it does not retain its original characteristics, including its replacement effect.
  
- **Death of the Manifested Nexus**: If the manifested **Nexus of Fate** dies, it will attempt to go to the graveyard. However, we must consider the replacement effect of **Nexus of Fate**. According to the rules, when a card with a replacement effect is put into a graveyard, that effect applies regardless of the card's current characteristics. 

- **Replacement Effect Activation**: The replacement effect of **Nexus of Fate** states that if it would be put into a graveyard from anywhere, it is instead revealed and shuffled into its owner's library. This effect applies even if the card is currently a face-down creature, as the replacement effect is tied to the card itself, not its current state.

- **Last Known Information (LKI)**: When the manifested **Nexus of Fate** dies, the game will look at its Last Known Information, which includes its original text and abilities. Thus, the replacement effect will still trigger, and the card will be shuffled into the library instead of going to the graveyard.

### 3. The Ruling
When the manifested **Nexus of Fate** dies, its replacement effect activates, and it is shuffled into its owner's library instead of being put into the graveyard.

### Sources

32,"If I turn a manifested creature face-up in response to [[Path to Exile]], does the spell fizzle?","The creature will be exiled. This happens because turning a creature face-up does not make it a new object; it remains the exact same permanent on the battlefield, merely changing its visible characteristics. Since the creature is still a legal target for the spell (it is still a creature and usually hasn't gained protection or hexproof), Path to Exile resolves and exiles it normally.",hard,"Zones, Objects & State-Based Actions","Ah, the intricacies of the stack and the timing of spells! Let us delve into this interaction with precision.

### 1. The Interaction
The key cards in this scenario are **Path to Exile**, an instant that exiles a target creature, and a **manifested creature**, which is a creature card that has been turned face down. The question at hand is whether turning the manifested creature face up in response to Path to Exile causes the spell to fizzle.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Step 1: Casting Path to Exile**: When you cast Path to Exile, you choose a target creature. If that creature is a manifested card, it is currently face down and has no characteristics (Rule 406.3a).
  
- **Step 2: Responding to Path to Exile**: If you choose to turn the manifested creature face up in response to Path to Exile, you are revealing it as a creature card. At this point, it now has characteristics and is a valid target for Path to Exile.

- **Step 3: Resolution of Path to Exile**: When Path to Exile resolves, it checks the legality of its target. Since the creature is now face up and a valid target, Path to Exile will successfully exile it. The spell does not fizzle because the target is legal at the time of resolution.

- **Crucially**, the act of turning the manifested creature face up does not affect the resolution of Path to Exile. The spell only fails to resolve if the target is illegal at the time of resolution, which is not the case here.

33,"If [[Brawn]] is in my graveyard and I control only a [[Snow-Covered Forest]], will my creatures still have Trample?","Yes, your creatures will have trample. This happens because Brawn's ability checks for the subtype Forest, not for a card specifically named Forest. Since Snow-Covered Forests possess the Forest subtype line, they satisfy the condition required to grant the bonus.",hard,"Continuous Effects, Layers & Copying","Ah, a delightful inquiry into the nuances of static abilities and the interplay of card types! 

### 1. The Interaction
We are examining the relationship between the creature card **Brawn**, which grants trample to your creatures while it resides in your graveyard, and the land card **Snow-Covered Forest**, which is a basic snow land.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
First, let us recall the specific ability of Brawn: it states that as long as it is in your graveyard and you control a Forest, your creatures gain trample. The key here is the definition of a ""Forest."" 

- **Step 1**: Identify the type of land you control. A **Snow-Covered Forest** is indeed a Forest, as it retains the Forest subtype despite being a snow land. The supertype ""snow"" does not alter its fundamental type.
  
- **Step 2**: Since you control a Forest (the Snow-Covered Forest), the condition for Brawn's ability is satisfied. 

- **Step 3**: Brawn's ability is static and does not require any additional activation or resolution; it simply applies as long as the conditions are met. Thus, your creatures will indeed gain trample.

Crucially, do not be misled by the presence of the ""snow"" supertype; it does not negate the Forest subtype. The ability of Brawn is still in effect as long as the conditions are fulfilled.

### 3. The Ruling
Your creatures will have trample because Brawn is in your graveyard and you control a Snow-Covered Forest, which qualifies as a Forest.

### Sources

34,"If I have a [[Cecil, Dark Knight]] transformed into [[Cecil, Redeemed Paladin]], can I play a second [[Cecil, Dark Knight]] or will the legend rule make me sacrifice one?","You can keep both. This happens because the Legend Rule applies only when you control two or more legendary permanents with the exact same name.

### 1. The Interaction
You are considering the scenario where you have a transformed [[Cecil, Dark Knight]] into [[Cecil, Redeemed Paladin]] and whether you can play a second [[Cecil, Dark Knight]] without triggering the legend rule.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Legend Rule**: The legend rule states that if a player controls two or more legendary permanents with the same name, that player must choose one to keep and put the others into their owner's graveyard (Rule 704.5j).
- **Transformation**: When you transform [[Cecil, Dark Knight]], it becomes [[Cecil, Redeemed Paladin]]. However, it is still considered the same object for the purposes of the game, merely changing its characteristics (Rule 712.18).
- **Playing a Second Cecil**: If you attempt to play a second [[Cecil, Dark Knight]], it will enter the battlefield as a new object with the same name as the one you already control. Since the legend rule applies, you will have to choose which one to keep.

Crucially, the fact that one is transformed does not exempt it from the legend rule; both are still recognized as ""Cecil"" for the purposes of this rule.

### 3. The Ruling
You cannot play a second [[Cecil, Dark Knight]] while you control a [[Cecil, Redeemed Paladin]] without triggering the legend rule, which will require you to sacrifice one of them.

35,"I cast a [[Clown Car]], while I control [[Omarthis, Ghostfire Initiate]]. Will [[Omarthis]] get a counter for each counter [[Clown Car]] gets or just one?","Just one counter. This happens because Omarthis triggers whenever one or more counters are placed, treating the simultaneous placement of multiple counters as a single event.

Let us dissect this interaction with precision.

### 1. The Interaction
You have cast a **Clown Car**, and you control **Omarthis, Ghostfire Initiate**. The key mechanical conflict revolves around how counters are distributed and how Omarthis's ability triggers in response to the Clown Car's effects.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
1. **Clown Car Enters**: When Clown Car enters the battlefield, you roll X six-sided dice, where X is the mana cost you paid. For each odd result, you create a 1/1 Clown Robot token, and for each even result, you put a +1/+1 counter on Clown Car.

2. **Omarthis's Trigger**: Omarthis has an ability that triggers whenever you put one or more +1/+1 counters on another colorless creature. Since Clown Car is a colorless artifact and you are putting +1/+1 counters on it, Omarthis's ability will trigger for each +1/+1 counter that Clown Car receives.

3. **Counter Distribution**: The crucial point here is that Omarthis's ability does not limit the number of counters it can receive based on the number of counters Clown Car gets. Instead, it will receive one +1/+1 counter for each instance of a +1/+1 counter being placed on Clown Car. Thus, if Clown Car receives multiple counters, Omarthis will receive a +1/+1 counter for each of those instances.

4. **Final Count**: If, for example, you rolled four dice and received two even results, Clown Car would get two +1/+1 counters, and Omarthis would also receive two +1/+1 counters as a result of its triggered ability.

The key cards in question are **Platinum Emperion**, which prevents the opponent's life total from changing, and **Etali, Primal Sickness**, which deals damage to the opponent and, due to its infect ability, would normally give poison counters instead of causing life loss.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Step 1: Damage Resolution**: When **Etali, Primal Sickness** attacks and deals damage to the opponent, this damage is indeed dealt, but it does not cause the opponent to lose life due to the effect of **Platinum Emperion**. However, it is crucial to note that the damage is still considered to have been dealt.
  
- **Step 2: Infect Mechanic**: According to the rules governing infect (Rule 702.90b), damage dealt to a player by a source with infect does not cause that player to lose life; instead, it results in the player receiving poison counters. The key here is that the damage is still dealt, and thus the effect of infect applies.

- **Step 3: Interaction with Platinum Emperion**: The presence of **Platinum Emperion** does not negate the effect of infect. The opponent will still receive poison counters equal to the damage dealt by **Etali, Primal Sickness**. The inability to change their life total does not affect the mechanics of poison counters, as they are a separate entity from life totals.

### 3. The Ruling
Therefore, your opponent will indeed receive poison counters from the damage dealt by **Etali, Primal Sickness**, despite their life total not changing.

### Sources

The logic provided in the Bot's answer supports this ruling, referencing the relevant rules accurately."
37,"If I have a [[Tajuru Blightblade]] and cast [[Blizzard Brawl]] targetting it and a 5/5 creature, does [[Blightblade]] kill that creature?","Yes, the 5/5 creature will die. This happens because the Fight mechanic causes the creatures to deal damage equal to their power to each other directly. Since Tajuru Blightblade has Deathtouch, any amount of damage it deals is considered lethal. Even if the Blightblade dies from the 5 damage it takes in return (assuming you don't meet the Snow requirement for Indestructible), the 1 damage it inflicts is enough to destroy the opponent's creature.",hard,Combat & Damage Mechanics,"Ah, a delightful inquiry into the mechanics of combat and the interaction of abilities! Let us dissect this scenario with precision.

### 1. The Interaction
You have a **Tajuru Blightblade** (1/1 with deathtouch) and you cast **Blizzard Brawl**, targeting your Blightblade and an opposing 5/5 creature. The crux of the matter lies in the resolution of Blizzard Brawl and the implications of deathtouch.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Casting Blizzard Brawl**: Upon casting Blizzard Brawl, you must choose both a creature you control (Tajuru Blightblade) and a creature you do not control (the 5/5). This is a valid choice.
  
- **Resolution of Blizzard Brawl**: As Blizzard Brawl resolves, it checks if you control three or more snow permanents. Assuming you do, the Blightblade receives a +1/+0 boost, making it a 2/1, and gains indestructible until end of turn. 

- **The Fight**: The two creatures then fight. In this case, the Tajuru Blightblade, now a 2/1, deals 2 damage to the 5/5 creature. Crucially, because the Blightblade has deathtouch, this damage is sufficient to destroy the 5/5 creature, as any amount of damage dealt by a source with deathtouch is enough to mark it for destruction.

- **State-Based Actions**: After the fight, state-based actions are checked. The 5/5 creature, having received 2 damage from the Blightblade, is destroyed as a result of the deathtouch ability.

### 3. The Ruling
Yes, the Tajuru Blightblade will indeed kill the 5/5 creature due to its deathtouch ability, as it deals sufficient damage during the fight.

### Sources
[[Tajuru Blightblade]], [Rule 702.2b (Deathtouch)]  
[[Blizzard Brawl]], [Rule 120.5 (Damage and Destruction)]",Yes,5,CORRECT,"The Bot's final answer in section 3 correctly states that the Tajuru Blightblade will kill the 5/5 creature due to its deathtouch ability, which aligns perfectly with the Ground Truth.

The rules cited are relevant and reinforce the correctness of the ruling."
38,"If I have a [[Phyrexian Obliterator]] and cast [[Blizzard Brawl]] targetting it and a 5/5 creature, does my opponent have to sacrifice 5 permanents?","Yes, the opponent must sacrifice 5 permanents. This happens because the Fight mechanic causes the creatures to deal damage to each other directly. Even though you cast the spell, the damage dealt to your Phyrexian Obliterator comes from the opponent's creature (the source). Since the Obliterator triggers whenever a source deals damage to it, the ability activates and forces the controller of that source (your opponent) to sacrifice permanents equal to the damage dealt.",hard,Combat & Damage Mechanics,"Ah, the intricacies of combat and damage resolution! Let us delve into the mechanics at play here.

### 1. The Interaction
You are casting **Blizzard Brawl**, targeting your **Phyrexian Obliterator** and an opposing 5/5 creature. The key conflict arises from the interaction between the damage dealt during the fight and the Obliterator's ability.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Casting Blizzard Brawl**: As you cast **Blizzard Brawl**, you must choose both a creature you control (the Phyrexian Obliterator) and a creature you do not control (the opposing 5/5) as targets. Assuming both are legal targets, the spell resolves.
  
- **Resolution of Blizzard Brawl**: Blizzard Brawl checks if you control three or more snow permanents. If you do, the Obliterator receives a +1/+0 boost and gains indestructible until end of turn. Regardless of whether it receives these bonuses, the fight will still occur.

- **Damage Calculation**: The Phyrexian Obliterator, being a 5/5, will deal 5 damage to the opposing creature, and the opposing creature will deal 5 damage back to the Obliterator. 

- **Obliterator's Ability**: Now, here is the crux of the matter: when the Obliterator is dealt damage, its ability triggers. This ability states that whenever a source deals damage to it, the controller of that source must sacrifice that many permanents. Since the Obliterator is dealt 5 damage, its controller (your opponent) must sacrifice 5 permanents.

- **State-Based Actions**: After the fight resolves, the opposing creature will be destroyed due to lethal damage, but this does not affect the Obliterator's ability to trigger. The damage dealt does not destroy the Obliterator; rather, it simply leads to the sacrifice requirement.

### 3. The Ruling
Yes, your opponent must sacrifice 5 permanents as a result of the Phyrexian Obliterator being dealt damage during the fight.

39,"I control [[Ghostly Prison]] and activate [[Nahiri, the Unforgiving]] +1 ability. Does this force my opponent to pay 2 mana to attack me?","No, they do not have to pay. This happens because the rules for combat requirements state that a player is never forced to pay a cost (like mana or life) to fulfill a requirement to attack. Your opponent can simply choose not to pay the 2. However, if there is another opponent they can attack for free (in a multiplayer game), they must attack that player to satisfy Nahiri's requirement.",hard,Combat & Damage Mechanics,"Ah, the intricacies of combat and cost management in Magic: The Gathering! Let us delve into the mechanics at play here.

### 1. The Interaction
You control **Ghostly Prison**, which imposes a cost on creatures attacking you, and you activate **Nahiri, the Unforgiving**'s +1 ability, which allows a target creature to attack a player each combat if able.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Ghostly Prison** states that creatures cannot attack you unless their controller pays {2} for each creature that is attacking you. This is a cost that must be paid when the creature attempts to attack.
- When you activate **Nahiri's** +1 ability, you target a creature, compelling it to attack a player if able. However, the ability does not override the restrictions imposed by **Ghostly Prison**.
- Crucially, if the targeted creature is unable to attack due to the cost imposed by **Ghostly Prison**, the controller is not forced to pay that cost. If they choose not to pay the {2}, the creature simply does not attack.
- According to Rule 508.1h, the total cost to attack is determined at the time of the attack declaration. If the cost to attack is unpayable (as it is in this case if the controller opts not to pay), the creature will not attack.

### 3. The Ruling
Thus, while Nahiri's ability allows the creature to attack, it does not force your opponent to pay the {2} required by **Ghostly Prison**; they may choose not to pay, and the creature will not attack you.

### Sources

40,If [[Blightbeetle]] blocks a green creature with trample is the excess damage still applied to the defending player?,"Yes, the excess damage hits the player. This happens because Trample assigns damage based on the blocker's toughness, ignoring prevention effects like Protection. The green creature assigns just enough damage to kill the Blightbeetle (normally 1 damage), and the rest tramples over. The damage assigned to the Beetle is prevented.",hard,Combat & Damage Mechanics,"Ah, a most intriguing scenario involving the interplay of trample and protection! Let us dissect this interaction with the precision it deserves.

### 1. The Interaction
The key cards in this situation are **Blightbeetle**, which has protection from green and prevents opponents' creatures from receiving +1/+1 counters, and a **green creature with trample**. The mechanical conflict arises from how damage is assigned when Blightbeetle blocks the green creature.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Step 1: Blocking**: When Blightbeetle blocks the green creature with trample, it is important to note that Blightbeetle's protection from green means it cannot be dealt damage by the green creature. However, the rules of trample dictate that the attacking creature must assign damage to the blocker first.
  
- **Step 2: Damage Assignment**: According to Rule 702.19b, the controller of the attacking creature must assign damage equal to the toughness of the blocking creature (in this case, Blightbeetle has a toughness of 1). Since Blightbeetle cannot be dealt damage due to its protection, the attacking creature effectively assigns lethal damage to it, which is 0 in this case.

- **Step 3: Excess Damage**: After assigning damage to the blocker, any excess damage can be assigned to the defending player. However, since Blightbeetle cannot take any damage, the attacking creature's controller can assign all of its damage to the defending player. 

- **Step 4: Conclusion**: The key point here is that while Blightbeetle is blocking, it does not absorb any damage due to its protection. Therefore, any damage that exceeds the assigned lethal damage (which is effectively none) can indeed be assigned to the defending player.

### 3. The Ruling
Yes, the excess damage from the green creature with trample is still applied to the defending player, as Blightbeetle cannot be dealt damage due to its protection.

### Sources
[[Blightbeetle]], [Rule 702.19b (Trample)]",Yes,5,CORRECT,"The Bot's final answer in section 3 correctly states that the excess damage from the green creature with trample is applied to the defending player, which aligns with the Ground Truth.

Therefore, the answer is both technically correct and well-supported by the relevant rules."
41,Do I need to have [[The Omenkeel]] in play to play the lands exiled with it?,"No, you do not need it in play. This happens because the permission to play the lands is part of the triggered ability's resolution, not a separate static ability. When the ability resolves, it sets up a lasting permission that applies to those specific cards for as long as they remain exiled. Even if The Omenkeel leaves the battlefield, that permission persists.",hard,"Zones, Objects & State-Based Actions","Ah, a question that delves into the intricacies of exiled cards and their interactions! 

### 1. The Interaction
The key cards in question are **The Omenkeel** and the lands exiled with it. The query revolves around whether The Omenkeel must be on the battlefield to play the lands that have been exiled due to its ability.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Exile Mechanism**: When The Omenkeel deals combat damage to a player, it triggers its ability, allowing you to exile cards from the top of that player's library. This ability does not require The Omenkeel to remain on the battlefield for the exiled cards to be played.
- **Independence of Abilities**: Once the ability of The Omenkeel resolves and the cards are exiled, they exist independently of The Omenkeel. This is a crucial point; the exiled cards retain their status and can be played as long as they remain in exile, regardless of the fate of The Omenkeel.
- **Playing Exiled Cards**: You may play lands from among the cards exiled with The Omenkeel for as long as they remain exiled. This means that even if The Omenkeel leaves the battlefield, the lands can still be played.

### 3. The Ruling
You do not need to have The Omenkeel in play to play the lands exiled with it; they can be played as long as they remain exiled.

42,Can I play [[Consign to Memory]] to avoid paying the Ward 4 cost of [[Kappa Cannoneer]] and kill it with [[Dismember]]?,"Yes, you can. This happens because Ward is a triggered ability, and Consign to Memory has a mode that specifically counters target triggered ability. You can legally target and counter the Ward trigger, removing the requirement to pay 4.",hard,"The Stack, Timing & Priority","Ah, the intricacies of spell interactions and the nuances of ward mechanics! Let us delve into this fascinating scenario.

### 1. The Interaction
We have three key cards at play: **Kappa Cannoneer**, which has a ward ability requiring a payment of 4 mana to target it; **Dismember**, which targets a creature and gives it -5/-5 until end of turn; and **Consign to Memory**, which can counter triggered abilities.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
1. **Casting Dismember**: When you cast **Dismember**, you target **Kappa Cannoneer**. However, because Kappa Cannoneer has ward {4}, you must pay 4 mana to target it successfully. If you do not pay this cost, the spell will be countered.

2. **Using Consign to Memory**: You might consider casting **Consign to Memory** to counter the ward ability of Kappa Cannoneer. However, it is crucial to note that **Consign to Memory** can only counter triggered abilities or colorless spells. The ward ability is a static ability that prevents targeting unless the cost is paid, not a triggered ability. Therefore, **Consign to Memory** cannot counter the ward ability.

3. **Conclusion on Targeting**: Since you cannot counter the ward ability with **Consign to Memory**, you are still required to pay the ward cost of 4 mana when you attempt to target Kappa Cannoneer with **Dismember**. If you do not pay this cost, **Dismember** will be countered and will not resolve.

### 3. The Ruling
You cannot use **Consign to Memory** to avoid paying the ward cost of **Kappa Cannoneer**, and thus you cannot target it with **Dismember** unless you pay the ward cost.

### Sources

The Bot's logic incorrectly categorizes the ward ability as a static ability rather than recognizing that it can be countered as a triggered ability. Therefore, the final ruling does not align with the technical truth."
43,"If I control an [[Encroaching Mycosynth]], does [[Karn, the Great Creator]] -2 ability allow me to get any card from my sideboard/outside the game?","No, you cannot get non-artifact cards from your sideboard. This happens because static abilities on the battlefield (like Encroaching Mycosynth) only affect objects within the game's zones (Library, Hand, Graveyard, Exile, Stack, Command). The sideboard is considered ""outside the game,"" so the cards there remain unchanged. You can still only fetch cards that are naturally artifacts.",hard,"Zones, Objects & State-Based Actions","Ah, a most intriguing inquiry regarding the interaction between these two artifacts! Let us delve into the mechanics at play.

### 1. The Interaction
The key cards in question are **Encroaching Mycosynth**, which turns all nonland permanents you control into artifacts, and **Karn, the Great Creator**, whose -2 ability allows you to retrieve an artifact card from outside the game or from exile.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Encroaching Mycosynth** transforms all nonland permanents you control into artifacts. This includes any Auras, creatures, or other permanents you may have on the battlefield.
- **Karn, the Great Creator** has a -2 ability that allows you to reveal an artifact card you own from outside the game or choose a face-up artifact card you own in exile. Importantly, the ability specifies that it can only retrieve an artifact card you own.
- The crucial point here is that while **Encroaching Mycosynth** makes your permanents artifacts, it does not change the ownership of any cards. The ownership of a card is determined by who started the game with it in their sideboard, as per Rule 108.3b.
- Therefore, if you have an artifact card in your sideboard, you may indeed use Karn's ability to retrieve it, provided you own that card. If the card is not in your sideboard or you do not own it, you cannot retrieve it.

### 3. The Ruling
If you control **Encroaching Mycosynth**, you can use **Karn, the Great Creator**'s -2 ability to retrieve an artifact card from your sideboard, as long as you own that card.

### Sources

The Ground Truth clearly states that you cannot get non-artifact cards from your sideboard, and since Karn's ability can only retrieve artifact cards, the Bot's conclusion is incorrect. The logic provided in section 2 does not support the ruling in section 3, as it fails to acknowledge that the sideboard is considered 'outside the game' and that only artifact cards can be retrieved."
44,"If I target my [[Walking Ballista]] with [[Heliod, Sun-Crowned]] ability, does [[Ballista]] go infinite?","Yes, this creates an infinite damage loop, provided Walking Ballista has at least two +1/+1 counters. This happens because Heliod grants the Ballista Lifelink. When you remove a counter to deal damage, you gain life, which triggers Heliod to put a +1/+1 counter back on the Ballista. This effectively refunds the cost of the ability, allowing you to repeat the process indefinitely until you win. The Ballista must be a 2/2 or larger so it doesn't die when you remove the first counter.",hard,Combat & Damage Mechanics,"Ah, the intricacies of synergy between enchantments and artifacts! Let us delve into the mechanics at play here.

### 1. The Interaction
The key cards in question are **Heliod, Sun-Crowned** and **Walking Ballista**. Heliod's ability allows you to put a +1/+1 counter on a target creature or enchantment whenever you gain life, while Walking Ballista enters the battlefield with X +1/+1 counters and can remove those counters to deal damage.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
1. **Heliod's Trigger**: When you gain life, Heliod's ability triggers, allowing you to put a +1/+1 counter on a target creature or enchantment you control. If you target Walking Ballista with this ability, it will receive a +1/+1 counter.
   
2. **Walking Ballista's Ability**: Walking Ballista has the ability to remove a +1/+1 counter to deal 1 damage to any target. Thus, if you have at least one +1/+1 counter on it, you can activate this ability.

3. **Life Gain Event**: If you gain life again (perhaps through another source), Heliod's ability will trigger once more, allowing you to put another +1/+1 counter on Walking Ballista.

4. **Infinite Loop Consideration**: The crux of the matter lies in whether you can create an infinite loop. If you can continuously gain life (for instance, through a lifelink creature dealing damage), you can keep triggering Heliod's ability to place counters on Walking Ballista. Each time you remove a counter from Walking Ballista to deal damage, you can gain life again, thus triggering Heliod's ability anew.

5. **Conditions for Infinity**: For this loop to be infinite, you must have a consistent source of life gain that can be triggered by the damage dealt by Walking Ballista. If such a source exists, you can indeed create an infinite loop of gaining life, adding counters to Walking Ballista, and dealing damage.

### 3. The Ruling
If you have a reliable source of life gain, targeting Walking Ballista with Heliod's ability can indeed create an infinite loop of life gain and damage.

### Sources
[[Heliod, Sun-Crowned]], [Rule 601.2c (Choosing Targets)]  
[[Walking Ballista]], [Rule 115.9a (Targets)]",Yes,5,CORRECT,"The Bot's final ruling correctly states that targeting Walking Ballista with Heliod's ability can create an infinite loop of life gain and damage, provided there is a reliable source of life gain. This aligns with the Ground Truth, which also confirms the infinite damage loop under the same conditions. The Bot's explanation in the logic section supports this ruling, detailing the mechanics involved and the necessary conditions for the loop to occur."
45,"If I cast [[Sculpting Steel]] as a copy of [[Cityscape Leveler]], do I get the 'When you cast this spell' trigger?","No, you do not get the trigger. This happens because 'When you cast this spell' triggers fire the moment the spell is placed on the stack. At that specific moment, the card is still just Sculpting Steel and does not have the text of the Leveler. It only becomes a copy as it resolves and enters the battlefield, which is long after the cast event has already occurred.",hard,"The Stack, Timing & Priority","Ah, a most intriguing inquiry regarding the nuances of triggered abilities and copying artifacts! 

### 1. The Interaction
You are considering the interaction between **Sculpting Steel** and **Cityscape Leveler**. Specifically, you wish to know if you will receive the triggered ability of Cityscape Leveler when Sculpting Steel enters the battlefield as a copy of it.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
First, let us clarify the mechanics at play here. When you cast **Sculpting Steel** as a copy of **Cityscape Leveler**, it enters the battlefield with the same characteristics as Cityscape Leveler, including its abilities. However, we must examine the nature of the triggered ability in question.

1. **Triggered Ability**: Cityscape Leveler has a triggered ability that states, ""When you cast this spell and whenever this creature attacks, destroy up to one target nonland permanent."" This ability is contingent upon the act of casting the original Cityscape Leveler.
   
2. **Copying Mechanics**: According to the rules, when you copy an artifact like Cityscape Leveler with Sculpting Steel, you do not actually cast the original Cityscape Leveler; rather, you are casting a copy of it. The key distinction here is that the ability ""When you cast this spell"" refers specifically to the original spell being cast, not to any copies created thereafter.

3. **Absence of Trigger**: Since Sculpting Steel is not casting the original Cityscape Leveler but rather a copy, the triggered ability ""When you cast this spell"" does not trigger. It is important to note that while Sculpting Steel will have the same abilities as Cityscape Leveler, it does not trigger the casting ability because it is not the original spell being cast.

### 3. The Ruling
Thus, you will not receive the 'When you cast this spell' trigger when you cast Sculpting Steel as a copy of Cityscape Leveler.

### Sources

46,"I have a [[Vodalian Hexcatcher]] in play and multiple other merfolk creatures, and my opponent plays a noncreature spell. Can I sacrifice a merfolk then if my opponent decides to pay 1, sacrifice another one, and so on?","This happens because objects on the stack resolve individually, and players receive priority again after each resolution. When your first activation resolves and the opponent pays the 1, their original spell is still on the stack waiting to resolve. Before it can resolve, the game must pass priority to you again, giving you the opportunity to activate the Hexcatcher a second time, sacrifice another Merfolk, and force them to pay another 1. You can repeat this taxing process until you run out of Merfolk or they run out of mana.",hard,"The Stack, Timing & Priority","Ah, the intricacies of spell interactions and cost management! Let us delve into the mechanics at play here.

### 1. The Interaction
You have a **Vodalian Hexcatcher** on the battlefield, along with several other Merfolk. Your opponent casts a noncreature spell, triggering the opportunity for you to utilize the Hexcatcher's ability to counter that spell by sacrificing a Merfolk.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Initial Trigger**: When your opponent casts a noncreature spell, you may activate the ability of Vodalian Hexcatcher, which allows you to sacrifice a Merfolk to counter that spell unless its controller pays {1}.
- **Cost Payment**: When you activate the Hexcatcher's ability, you must choose a Merfolk to sacrifice as part of the cost. This is done at the time you activate the ability, as per Rule 601.2b.
- **Opponent's Response**: After you sacrifice a Merfolk and the ability is placed on the stack, your opponent has the option to pay {1} to avoid the counter. If they choose to pay, the spell remains on the stack.
- **Subsequent Sacrifices**: You may then activate the Hexcatcher's ability again by sacrificing another Merfolk. However, you cannot sacrifice the same Merfolk again, as each sacrifice must be a different creature. This process can continue as long as you have Merfolk to sacrifice and your opponent chooses to pay the {1} cost each time.

Crucially, observe that each activation of the Hexcatcher's ability is independent. Once you place an ability on the stack, it exists separately from its source, allowing you to continue to respond with additional sacrifices if you have the creatures available.

### 3. The Ruling
You may sacrifice a Merfolk to counter the noncreature spell, and if your opponent pays {1}, you can continue to sacrifice additional Merfolk for subsequent activations of the Hexcatcher's ability, provided you have enough Merfolk to sacrifice.

### Sources
[[Vodalian Hexcatcher]], [Rule 601.2b (Choosing Costs)]",Yes,5,CORRECT,"The Bot's final ruling accurately reflects the mechanics of Vodalian Hexcatcher's ability and the interaction with the opponent's noncreature spell.

The Bot also correctly references Rule 601.2b regarding the timing of cost payment, supporting the ruling with appropriate rules context."
47,"I control four copies of [[Hare Apparent]] and cast [[Ghostway]]. When they all return to the battlefield simultaneously, how many tokens do I create? Does each Hare see the other three?","Yes, you are correct; you will create 12 tokens. This happens because when multiple creatures enter the battlefield at the same time, they all ""see"" each other for the purpose of triggering abilities. Each of the four Hare Apparents looks at the board, sees exactly three other Hare Apparents entering alongside it, and triggers to create three tokens.",hard,"Zones, Objects & State-Based Actions","Ah, a delightful inquiry into the mechanics of token generation and the nuances of simultaneous resolution! Let us dissect this interaction with precision.

### 1. The Interaction
You control four copies of **Hare Apparent** and cast **Ghostway**, which exiles all your creatures and returns them to the battlefield at the beginning of the next end step. The question at hand is how many 1/1 white Rabbit creature tokens you create upon their return and whether each Hare Apparent sees the others.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Exile and Return**: When you cast **Ghostway**, all four **Hare Apparent** creatures are exiled. Upon their return to the battlefield, they do so simultaneously.
  
- **Token Creation**: Each **Hare Apparent** has the ability that triggers upon entering the battlefield: ""When this creature enters, create a number of 1/1 white Rabbit creature tokens equal to the number of other creatures you control named Hare Apparent."" 

- **Simultaneous Entry**: Crucially, when the **Hare Apparent** creatures return, they all see each other as they enter the battlefield at the same time. Therefore, each **Hare Apparent** counts the other three as ""other creatures you control named Hare Apparent.""

- **Token Calculation**: Since each of the four **Hare Apparent** sees three others, each will create three tokens. Thus, the total number of tokens created is calculated as follows:
  - Each of the 4 **Hare Apparent** creates 3 tokens.
  - Total tokens = 4 (Hare Apparents) × 3 (tokens each) = 12 tokens.

### 3. The Ruling
You will create a total of 12 1/1 white Rabbit creature tokens when all four copies of **Hare Apparent** return to the battlefield, as each sees the other three.

48,"I am casting an opponent's card exiled with [[Gonti, Lord of Luxury]]. In response, he plays [[Aven Interrupter]] targeting that spell. Does the card go to my exile or the owner's exile, and who gets to cast it later?","It goes to the owner's exile, and the owner gets to cast it later. This happens because Aven Interrupter causes the spell to become Plotted. The rules for the Plot mechanic specifically state that the card's owner (not the player who controlled the spell on the stack) gains the permission to cast it from exile on a later turn without paying its mana cost.",hard,"The Stack, Timing & Priority","Ah, the intricacies of spell interactions and exiled cards! Let us delve into the mechanics at play here.

### 1. The Interaction
The key cards in this scenario are **Gonti, Lord of Luxury**, which allows you to cast an opponent's card exiled from their library, and **Aven Interrupter**, which exiles that spell in response to its casting.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- When you cast the card exiled by Gonti, it is indeed your opponent's card, but it is currently in your control due to Gonti's ability. 
- Upon casting that card, your opponent responds by casting **Aven Interrupter**, targeting the spell you are casting. 
- Aven Interrupter's ability exiles the targeted spell and makes it ""plotted."" This means that the spell is now exiled and can be cast later as a sorcery without paying its mana cost.
- Crucially, the spell is exiled from the battlefield, and since Aven Interrupter's ability does not specify that it must go to the original owner's exile zone, it remains in exile under your control. 
- The original owner of the spell (your opponent) will have the opportunity to cast it later, but only as a sorcery during their main phase while the stack is empty.

### 3. The Ruling
The card is exiled from the battlefield and remains in your opponent's exile zone, allowing them to cast it later as a sorcery.

If I activate [[Nomads en-Kor]] twice to redirect the damage it would take to the [[Needletooth Raptor]], will its Enrage ability trigger one, two, or three times?",It triggers just once. This happens because damage redirection creates a replacement effect that modifies the original damage event without splitting it up. The game sees a single simultaneous event where the spell deals 0 damage to the Nomads and 4 damage (2 natural + 2 redirected) to the Needletooth Raptor.,hard,"Zones, Objects & State-Based Actions","Ah, a delightful inquiry into the intricacies of damage redirection and triggered abilities! Let us dissect this interaction with precision.

### 1. The Interaction
You control both **Nomads en-Kor** and **Needletooth Raptor**. Your opponent casts a spell that deals 2 damage to all creatures. You intend to activate **Nomads en-Kor** twice to redirect the damage it would take to the **Needletooth Raptor**.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
1. **Damage Assignment**: The spell deals 2 damage to all creatures, which includes both **Nomads en-Kor** and **Needletooth Raptor**. 
2. **Redirection**: You activate **Nomads en-Kor**'s ability twice. Each activation allows you to redirect 1 damage that would be dealt to **Nomads en-Kor** to the **Needletooth Raptor**. Thus, you redirect a total of 2 damage to the **Needletooth Raptor**.
3. **Enrage Trigger**: The **Needletooth Raptor** is dealt damage, specifically 2 damage. According to its enrage ability, whenever it is dealt damage, it triggers and deals 5 damage to a target creature an opponent controls.
4. **Lethal Damage Consideration**: Importantly, the **Needletooth Raptor** is not destroyed by this damage since it has a toughness of 2 and is only dealt 2 damage. Therefore, it remains on the battlefield and its enrage ability triggers.

Crucially, observe that the enrage ability only triggers once for the total damage dealt to the **Needletooth Raptor**, regardless of how that damage was assigned or redirected. The enrage ability does not trigger multiple times for the same instance of damage; it simply triggers once for the total damage dealt.

### 3. The Ruling
The **Needletooth Raptor**'s enrage ability will trigger **once**, dealing 5 damage to a target creature an opponent controls.

50,"If I control a creature that I stole with [[Act of Treason]], and I use [[Cloudshift]] on it, do I keep it forever?","Yes, you keep it permanently. This happens because Cloudshift exiles the creature and returns it specifically 'under your control.' When the creature leaves and returns, it becomes a brand new game object. The temporary 'until end of turn' effect from [[Act of Treason]] loses track of it, and since you are the controller of the 'new' creature upon entry, it stays yours indefinitely.",hard,"Zones, Objects & State-Based Actions","Ah, a most intriguing inquiry regarding the interplay of control and exile! Let us dissect this interaction with precision.

### 1. The Interaction
The key cards in question are **Act of Treason**, which allows you to gain control of a target creature until the end of turn, and **Cloudshift**, which exiles a creature you control and returns it to the battlefield under your control. The mechanical conflict arises from the temporary nature of control granted by Act of Treason and the permanent nature of control established by Cloudshift.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
1. **Act of Treason Resolution**: When you cast Act of Treason, you gain control of the target creature until the end of your turn. This control is temporary and will revert back to the original owner at the end of the turn unless interrupted.

2. **Cloudshift Resolution**: When you cast Cloudshift targeting the creature you currently control (thanks to Act of Treason), the following occurs:
   - The creature is exiled. At this point, it ceases to exist on the battlefield and is treated as a new object when it returns.
   - Upon returning, the creature comes back under your control, as specified by Cloudshift's effect.

3. **Control Transition**: The crucial aspect here is that when the creature returns to the battlefield, it is considered a new object. Therefore, the temporary control granted by Act of Treason is no longer in effect. You now control the creature indefinitely because Cloudshift states that it returns ""under your control.""

4. **End of Turn Effect**: Since the creature is now a new object, the end-of-turn effect from Act of Treason does not apply. You have effectively circumvented the temporary nature of the control by exiling and returning the creature.

### 3. The Ruling
You will keep the creature permanently under your control after using Cloudshift, as it returns to the battlefield as a new object, independent of the temporary control granted by Act of Treason.

Understanding when one can cast a sorcery is fundamental to mastering the game.

### 1. The Interaction
The question pertains to the conditions under which a player may cast a sorcery spell.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
To cast a sorcery, one must adhere to specific timing rules. According to Rule 307.1, a player can cast a sorcery card from their hand during a main phase of their turn when the stack is empty. This means that the player must have priority, and no other spells or abilities are currently on the stack.

Furthermore, Rule 307.5 clarifies that if an effect states that a player can do something only “any time they could cast a sorcery,” it reinforces the requirement that the action must occur during a main phase with an empty stack. Importantly, the player does not need to have a sorcery card available to cast; they simply must follow the timing rules.

### 1. The Interaction
The key conflict here involves a creature with flying attempting to attack and whether it can be blocked by a creature that lacks both flying and reach.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Flying Mechanics**: According to Rule 702.9, a creature with flying cannot be blocked except by creatures that have flying or reach. This is a fundamental aspect of how flying operates in the game.
- **Reach Mechanics**: The reach ability, as defined in Rule 702.17, allows a creature to block flying creatures. Therefore, only creatures with flying or reach can effectively block an attacking creature with flying.
- **Blocking Conditions**: When a creature attacks, the defending player may only block with creatures they control that are eligible to block the attacking creature. Since the attacking creature has flying, it can only be blocked by creatures with flying or reach.

Crucially, if your creature does not possess either of these abilities, it is simply unable to block the flying creature. Do not be misled by the notion that any creature can block; the specific abilities of the creatures involved dictate the outcome.

### 3. The Ruling
You cannot block a creature that has flying with a creature that does not have flying or reach.

Your opponent is attacking you with a 2/2 creature, and you wish to block it using two 1/1 creatures. This situation raises questions about the legality of your blocking declaration.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Blocking Requirements**: According to Rule 509.1c, when a creature attacks, the defending player must check if they can fulfill any requirements that dictate how they must block. In this case, you are attempting to block a 2/2 creature with two 1/1 creatures.
- **Legal Blocking**: A 2/2 creature can be blocked by any number of creatures, provided that the total power of the blocking creatures is sufficient to assign lethal damage. In this instance, two 1/1 creatures can indeed block the 2/2 creature, as they collectively have a power of 2, which is sufficient to assign lethal damage to the attacking creature.
- **No Additional Restrictions**: There are no additional restrictions or abilities affecting the blocking of the 2/2 creature in this scenario, so you are free to declare your blockers as you wish.

### 1. The Interaction
The question at hand concerns the permanence of damage marked on a creature and whether it remains indefinitely.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
To elucidate this matter, we must first understand the mechanics of damage as they pertain to creatures. According to Rule 120.6, damage marked on a creature remains until the cleanup step. This means that while a creature is on the battlefield and has damage marked on it, that damage will persist through various phases of the game.

However, it is crucial to note that this damage does not last forever. During the cleanup step, all damage marked on a permanent is removed (as stated in Rule 514.2). Therefore, while damage can indeed remain on a creature for a significant duration, it is not eternal. 

Moreover, if a creature is dealt damage equal to or greater than its toughness, it is destroyed as a state-based action (Rule 704). This destruction is not a result of the damage itself but rather a consequence of the state of the game when state-based actions are checked.

### 3. The Ruling
In summary, damage dealt to a creature does not stay on it forever; it remains until the cleanup step, at which point all damage is removed.

### 1. The Interaction
You possess a creature that has been granted haste, and you wish to know if you can attack with it on the turn it enters the battlefield.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Understanding Haste**: Haste is a static ability that allows a creature to ignore the ""summoning sickness"" rule, which typically prevents creatures from attacking or activating abilities that require tapping unless they have been under their controller's control since the beginning of their most recent turn (Rule 702.10).
- **Entering the Battlefield**: When you play a creature with haste, it enters the battlefield and immediately gains the ability to attack, as it does not suffer from summoning sickness.
- **Active Player's Choice**: As the active player, you can choose to attack with any untapped creatures you control that have haste or have been under your control continuously since the turn began (Rule 508.1a).

### 1. The Interaction
The key concept here is the ability to cast instant spells, which is fundamentally different from casting sorceries. The question revolves around whether you can play an instant spell while it is your opponent's turn.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Understanding Priority**: According to Rule 117.1a, a player may cast an instant spell any time they have priority. This means that as long as it is your opponent's turn and you have priority, you can indeed cast an instant spell.
- **Opponent's Turn Dynamics**: During your opponent's turn, they will be the active player, but you will have opportunities to respond during their main phases or at any point they pass priority to you. 
- **Casting Instants**: Rule 304.1 states that a player who has priority may cast an instant card from their hand. Therefore, if your opponent has finished their actions and passed priority to you, you may cast an instant spell.
- **Split Second Consideration**: If your opponent has a spell with split second on the stack, you would be limited to casting only mana abilities until that spell resolves. However, once it resolves, you regain the ability to cast your instant spells.

### 1. The Interaction
The question revolves around the concept of unspent mana in your mana pool at the end of your Main Phase and whether it can be carried over to your opponent's turn.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Understanding the Mana Pool**: When you generate mana, it resides in your mana pool, as per Rule 106.4. This mana can be used immediately to pay costs or can remain unspent.
- **End of Phase Mechanics**: According to Rule 703.4q, at the end of each step or phase, any unspent mana in a player’s mana pool empties. This means that once your Main Phase concludes, any mana that has not been utilized will be lost.
- **Turn-Based Actions**: Rule 500.5 further clarifies that as a step or phase ends, effects that last until the end of that step or phase expire, and unspent mana is emptied. This is a turn-based action that does not use the stack, emphasizing that you cannot save mana for later use.

Let us delve into this matter with the precision it deserves.

### 1. The Interaction
The key conflict here revolves around the act of drawing a card when a player’s library is devoid of cards. This situation is governed by several rules that dictate the outcome of such an event.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Understanding Drawing**: According to Rule 121.1, drawing a card involves taking the top card from your library and placing it into your hand. However, if your library is empty, this action cannot be completed.
- **State-Based Actions**: Rule 121.4 states that if a player attempts to draw a card from an empty library, they will lose the game the next time a player would receive priority. This is a crucial point; the loss is not immediate but occurs as a state-based action.
- **Excess Draws**: Rule 104.3c further clarifies that if a player is required to draw more cards than are available in their library, they will draw the remaining cards (which is zero in this case) and subsequently lose the game.
- **Replacement Effects**: It is also important to note that if an effect replaces a card draw (as per Rule 614.11), this replacement is still applied even if the library is empty. However, if the replacement does not result in drawing a card, the player still faces the consequences of an empty library.

The key card in question is any creature with hexproof, which prevents it from being targeted by spells or abilities controlled by your opponents. The inquiry revolves around whether you can target such a creature with your own spells.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Understanding Hexproof**: Hexproof is a static ability that prevents a permanent from being targeted by spells or abilities controlled by your opponents (Rule 702.11b). Thus, if you control a spell or ability, you are not considered an opponent in this context.
- **Your Own Spells**: When you cast a spell or activate an ability, you are the controller of that effect. Therefore, you are not restricted by the hexproof ability of the creature you wish to target. You can indeed target a creature with hexproof with your own spells or abilities, as hexproof only applies to spells and abilities controlled by your opponents.
- **Clarification on Targeting**: It is crucial to note that hexproof does not prevent you from targeting your own creatures. The ability only restricts your opponents from targeting that creature.

### 1. The Interaction
You are considering a scenario where a 5/5 creature is blocked by a 1/1 creature. The key elements here are the power of the attacking creature and the toughness of the blocking creature.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Combat Damage Assignment**: According to Rule 510.1a, when a creature is blocked, it assigns its combat damage equal to its power. In this case, the 5/5 creature will attempt to assign 5 damage.
- **Blocking Creature's Toughness**: The 1/1 creature can only absorb 1 damage before it is destroyed, as its toughness is 1. Thus, it will assign all of its combat damage (which is 1) to the 5/5 creature, but it will not survive the encounter.
- **Excess Damage**: The remaining 4 damage (5 total damage minus the 1 damage assigned to the 1/1) must be assigned to the defending player, as per Rule 702.19b, which states that once all blocking creatures have been assigned lethal damage, any excess damage can be assigned to the defending player.

A fundamental aspect of gameplay that often leads to confusion. Let us delve into the mechanics of untapping your lands and creatures.

### 1. The Interaction
The key cards in this scenario are Bontu's Last Reckoning, Mudslide, and Urban Burgeoning. Each of these cards imposes restrictions on untapping, but they do so in different ways.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Bontu's Last Reckoning**: This sorcery destroys all creatures and prevents your lands from untapping during your next untap step. Thus, if you cast this spell, none of your lands will untap in the following untap step, regardless of their state when the spell resolves.
  
- **Mudslide**: This enchantment prevents creatures without flying from untapping during their controllers' untap steps. However, it allows for a potential untap during the upkeep if the player pays {2} for each tapped creature they wish to untap. Thus, if you have tapped creatures without flying, you can choose to pay the cost to untap them at the beginning of your upkeep.

- **Urban Burgeoning**: This enchantment allows the enchanted land to untap during each other player's untap step, meaning it will not be affected by the restrictions imposed by Bontu's Last Reckoning during your own untap step. 

Crucially, the untap step occurs after the upkeep phase, where you may have the opportunity to untap creatures if you have paid the necessary costs under Mudslide. Remember, the active player untaps all their permanents simultaneously, unless otherwise restricted by effects like those from Bontu's Last Reckoning or Mudslide.

### 3. The Ruling
You will untap your lands and creatures during your untap step unless they are affected by Bontu's Last Reckoning or Mudslide; specifically, lands will not untap if Bontu's Last Reckoning was cast, while creatures without flying may not untap unless you pay the cost specified by Mudslide during your upkeep.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Playing a Land**: When a player plays a land, it is considered a special action that does not use the stack (Rule 305.1). This means that it occurs immediately and cannot be responded to with spells or abilities.
- **Countering Spells**: Countering typically applies to spells, which are placed on the stack. Since playing a land does not involve the stack, it is not a spell and thus cannot be countered (Rule 505.6b).
- **Independence of Actions**: The action of playing a land is distinct from the resolution of spells or abilities. Therefore, you cannot use counterspells or similar effects to disrupt this action.

### 3. The Ruling
You cannot counter a land card when your opponent plays it, as playing a land is a special action that does not use the stack.

### Sources
[[Rule 305.1]], [[Rule 505.6b]]",You cannot counter a land card when your opponent plays it.,5,CORRECT,"The Bot's final ruling correctly states that you cannot counter a land card when your opponent plays it, aligning perfectly with the Ground Truth.

63,Does a creature with Deathtouch kill a player if it deals 1 damage to them?,"No. Deathtouch only applies to damage dealt to other creatures. If a Deathtouch creature hits a player, it just deals normal damage to their life total.",easy,Combat & Damage Mechanics,"Ah, a common misconception regarding the nature of deathtouch! Let us clarify this matter with precision.

### 1. The Interaction
The key concept here is the deathtouch ability and its interaction with damage dealt to creatures versus players. Deathtouch is a static ability that allows any amount of damage dealt by a creature with deathtouch to be considered lethal damage to other creatures, but it does not affect players in the same manner.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Understanding Deathtouch**: Deathtouch (Rule 702.2) means that any amount of damage dealt by a source with deathtouch is considered lethal damage for the purposes of determining if a creature is destroyed (Rule 704.5h). 
- **Damage to Players**: However, when a creature with deathtouch deals damage to a player, it does not confer any special effect. The rules governing damage to players do not include the lethal damage stipulation that applies to creatures. 
- **Damage Resolution**: If a creature with deathtouch deals 1 damage to a player, that player simply loses 1 life, as per the standard rules of combat damage (Rule 120.3). There is no additional effect from deathtouch in this context.

### 3. The Ruling
A creature with deathtouch does not kill a player if it deals 1 damage to them; it merely causes them to lose 1 life.

The logic provided in section 2 supports this ruling by accurately referencing the relevant rules regarding deathtouch and damage resolution."
64,Can I equip an Artifact Equipment to a creature at Instant speed?,"No. The Equip keyword can only be activated as a Sorcery. This means you can only do it during your Main Phase when the stack is empty, not in response to removal or during combat.",easy,"Costs, Mana & Casting Requirements","Ah, the nuances of timing in Magic: The Gathering! It is essential to grasp the distinction between various types of actions and their respective timing restrictions.

### 1. The Interaction
The question revolves around the ability to equip an Artifact Equipment to a creature at instant speed, specifically focusing on the timing of the equip ability.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Understanding Equip Timing**: The equip ability of an Equipment card is an activated ability that is specifically restricted to being activated only as a sorcery. This means that you cannot activate the equip ability during your opponent's turn or in response to other actions unless it is your main phase when the stack is empty.
- **Triggered Abilities**: However, it is crucial to note that some Equipment cards have triggered abilities that can attach themselves to a creature when they enter the battlefield. For instance, Javelin of Lightning has a triggered ability that attaches it to a creature upon entering the battlefield, which can occur at instant speed due to its flash ability.
- **State-Based Actions**: If an Equipment is already on the battlefield and you wish to attach it to a creature, you must use the equip ability, which cannot be done at instant speed. If the Equipment is not currently attached to a creature, you must wait until your main phase to activate the equip ability.

### 3. The Ruling
You cannot equip an Artifact Equipment to a creature at instant speed; the equip ability can only be activated during your main phase as a sorcery.

65,My opponent casts a spell. Can I cast a spell in response before theirs resolves?,"Yes. Magic uses a system called 'The Stack.' When a spell is cast, it goes on top of the stack. You can respond with an Instant or ability, which goes on top of theirs and will resolve first.",easy,"The Stack, Timing & Priority","Ah, the intricacies of the stack! It is a fundamental aspect of gameplay that every Magic player must grasp.

### 1. The Interaction
In this scenario, your opponent has cast a spell, and you are considering casting a spell in response to it.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- When your opponent casts a spell, it goes onto the stack, and they pass priority to you.
- You, as the next player in the turn order, now have the opportunity to respond. According to Rule 117.1a, you may cast an instant spell at any time you have priority, which includes the moment after your opponent's spell has been placed on the stack.
- If you choose to cast a spell in response, it will be placed on the stack above your opponent's spell. This is in accordance with Rule 117.7, which states that the new spell or ability resolves first, before the original spell that prompted your response.

### 3. The Ruling
Yes, you may cast a spell in response to your opponent's spell before theirs resolves.

### Sources

66,"If a creature is Indestructible, does it die if it takes damage equal to its toughness?","No. Indestructible prevents a creature from being destroyed by lethal damage or effects that say 'destroy.' It can still take damage, but the damage will not cause it to go to the graveyard.",easy,"Zones, Objects & State-Based Actions","Ah, a question that delves into the intricacies of indestructibility! Let us explore this concept with the precision it deserves.

### 1. The Interaction
We are examining a creature with the indestructible ability, which means it cannot be destroyed by lethal damage or effects that say ""destroy."" 

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Indestructible Defined**: A creature with indestructible, as per Rule 702.12b, cannot be destroyed by lethal damage. This means that even if it has damage marked on it equal to or greater than its toughness, it will not be destroyed as a state-based action.
- **Damage Marking**: When a creature takes damage, that damage is marked on it (Rule 302.4b). However, for a creature with indestructible, this marked damage does not lead to its destruction.
- **State-Based Actions**: According to Rule 704.5g, a creature is destroyed if it has lethal damage marked on it. However, since indestructible creatures ignore this state-based action, they remain on the battlefield regardless of the damage marked on them.

### 3. The Ruling
Thus, a creature with indestructible does not die even if it takes damage equal to its toughness.

67,Can I attack a specific creature my opponent controls?,"No. In Magic, you attack the player (or a Planeswalker). You declare your attackers, and then the defending player decides which of their creatures will block your attackers. You cannot force an attack directly onto a specific creature unless you use a specific 'Fight' spell.",easy,Combat & Damage Mechanics,"Ah, the intricacies of combat in Magic: The Gathering! It is essential to grasp the fundamental principles governing how creatures engage in battle.

### 1. The Interaction
The question at hand concerns whether you can attack a specific creature controlled by your opponent. 

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
To clarify, let us dissect the rules surrounding combat:

- **Rule 506.3** states that only a creature can attack or block, while only a player, a planeswalker, or a battle can be attacked. This means that when you declare attackers, you are not targeting creatures directly; rather, you are choosing a defending player or a planeswalker they control as the target of your attack.
  
- **Rule 802.3** further elucidates that as the attacking player declares each attacking creature, they must choose a defending player, a planeswalker controlled by that player, or a battle protected by that player for it to attack. Thus, you cannot attack a creature directly; you must attack the player or planeswalker.

- If you wish to influence the combat involving a specific creature, you may use abilities or spells that target that creature, but the act of attacking itself cannot be directed at a creature.

### 3. The Ruling
You cannot attack a specific creature your opponent controls; you must attack a player, a planeswalker they control, or a battle protected by that player.

### Sources
[[Rule 506.3]], [[Rule 802.3]]",No,5,CORRECT,"The Bot's final ruling correctly states that you cannot attack a specific creature controlled by your opponent, aligning perfectly with the Ground Truth. The logic provided in section 2 accurately references the relevant rules (506.3 and 802.3) that support this conclusion, confirming that attacks are directed at players or planeswalkers, not creatures. Therefore, the answer is both technically correct and well-supported by the rules."
68,What is the difference between an Artifact and an Enchantment?,"Mechanically, they are similar (permanent cards that sit on the board). The main difference is that Artifacts are usually colorless and represent objects or machines, while Enchantments are usually colored and represent magical effects or laws. They are affected by different removal spells.",easy,"Continuous Effects, Layers & Copying","Ah, the distinction between artifacts and enchantments is a fundamental concept in the realm of Magic: The Gathering, and it is essential to grasp these differences to navigate the game effectively.

### 1. The Interaction
Artifacts and enchantments are both permanent types in Magic, but they possess distinct characteristics and rules governing their behavior. 

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Artifacts**: These are permanents that can represent a wide variety of objects, such as equipment, vehicles, or treasures. They are defined by their unique set of subtypes (e.g., Equipment, Treasure) and typically do not have colored mana symbols in their mana costs, making them colorless by default. However, they can be colored if they have colored mana symbols in their effects or abilities.
  
- **Enchantments**: This category includes permanents that represent magical effects or enhancements. Enchantments can be further classified into subtypes, with Auras being a specific type of enchantment that attaches to other permanents or players. Enchantments can have various effects, but they do not have the same physical representation as artifacts.

- **Key Differences**: 
  - Artifacts can be creatures (artifact creatures) or non-creatures, while enchantments, specifically Auras, can only enchant other permanents or players.
  - Artifacts can have abilities that are activated or triggered, while enchantments often provide static effects or conditions that modify the game state.
  - The rules governing how they interact with other cards can differ significantly, particularly in how they are affected by spells and abilities.

### 3. The Ruling
In summary, artifacts are permanents that can represent a variety of physical objects and can be colorless or colored, while enchantments are magical effects that can enhance or modify other permanents or players, with Auras being a specific subtype that attaches to other objects.

### Sources

69,Can I tap a creature with Vigilance to make mana with [[Gene Pollinator]]'s ability?,"Yes. Vigilance specifically means the creature does not tap when it attacks. It does not prevent the creature from being tapped for other reasons. In fact, you can attack with it (keeping it untapped) and then tap it to activate the Pollinator in the same turn.",easy,"Costs, Mana & Casting Requirements","Ah, the intricacies of tapping creatures for mana! Let us delve into the mechanics at play here.

### 1. The Interaction
The key cards in this scenario are Gene Pollinator, an artifact creature with a mana-generating ability, and a creature with Vigilance. The question revolves around whether you can tap a creature with Vigilance to activate Gene Pollinator's ability.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Understanding Vigilance**: A creature with Vigilance does not tap when it attacks, allowing it to remain available for other actions, such as activating abilities.
- **Gene Pollinator's Ability**: To activate Gene Pollinator's ability, you must tap an untapped permanent you control. The ability itself requires the use of the tap symbol ({T}), which is crucial for our analysis.
- **Control Requirement**: According to Rule 602.5a, a creature's activated ability with the tap symbol cannot be activated unless the creature has been under its controller's control since the start of their most recent turn. However, this rule does not apply to creatures with Haste (Rule 702.10c).
- **Vigilance and Tapping**: Importantly, the act of tapping a creature with Vigilance does not interfere with its ability to remain untapped for attacking. Thus, you can tap a creature with Vigilance for mana, provided you have controlled that creature since the beginning of your most recent turn.

### 3. The Ruling
Yes, you can tap a creature with Vigilance to make mana with Gene Pollinator's ability, as long as you have controlled that creature continuously since the beginning of your most recent turn.

### 1. The Interaction
You have two legendary creatures on the battlefield with the exact same name. This situation directly invokes the ""legend rule,"" which governs how multiple legendary permanents with the same name are handled.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Step 1: Identify the Rule**: The ""legend rule"" states that if a player controls two or more legendary permanents with the same name, that player must choose one to keep and put the rest into their owners' graveyards. This is codified in Rule 704.5j.
  
- **Step 2: Apply the Rule**: Since you control two legendary creatures with the same name, you must choose one of them to remain on the battlefield. The other creature will be sent to the graveyard as a state-based action.

- **Step 3: Consider Additional Effects**: If any effects or abilities are in play that might alter this situation (such as those from Mirror Box, which allows you to control multiple legendary permanents without the legend rule applying), they would need to be considered. However, in the absence of such effects, the legend rule applies straightforwardly.

### 3. The Ruling
You must choose one of the two legendary creatures with the same name to keep on the battlefield, while the other is put into your graveyard.

### 1. The Interaction
The question at hand concerns the order of actions during your turn, specifically whether you can play a creature before playing a land.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Understanding Turn Phases**: During your turn, you have the opportunity to play spells and activate abilities during your main phases. The rules dictate that you can play one land during each of your turns, provided the stack is empty and you have priority.
- **Playing a Creature**: When you choose to cast a creature spell, you must pay its mana cost and place it on the stack. This action uses the stack, meaning that it can be responded to by other players.
- **Playing a Land**: In contrast, playing a land is a special action that does not use the stack. You simply put the land onto the battlefield from your hand during a main phase when the stack is empty.

Crucially, there is no restriction preventing you from casting a creature spell before playing a land. You may choose to do so, as long as you adhere to the rules regarding priority and the state of the stack.

### 3. The Ruling
You may indeed play a creature before you play a land on your turn, as the two actions are independent of one another.

73,"If a creature has Vigilance, what does that mean?","It means attacking does not cause the creature to tap. Normally, attacking requires tapping. A Vigilance creature stays upright, meaning it can attack on your turn and still be available to block on your opponent's turn.",easy,Combat & Damage Mechanics,"Ah, the concept of vigilance is indeed a fundamental aspect of combat mechanics in Magic: The Gathering. Let us delve into its implications.

### 1. The Interaction
The card in question is ""Vigilance,"" an enchantment that grants the enchanted creature the ability to attack without tapping.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Understanding Vigilance**: According to Rule 702.20b, a creature with vigilance does not tap when it attacks. This is a crucial distinction in combat, as it allows the creature to remain available for blocking during the opponent's turn.
- **Static Ability**: Vigilance is classified as a static ability (Rule 702.20a), meaning it continuously modifies the rules for the declare attackers step. This ability is always ""on"" as long as the creature is enchanted with Vigilance.
- **Redundancy**: It is also important to note that multiple instances of vigilance on the same creature are redundant (Rule 702.20c). Thus, if a creature were to gain vigilance from multiple sources, it would still only benefit from the effect of vigilance once.

### 3. The Ruling
A creature with vigilance does not tap when it attacks, allowing it to remain untapped and available for blocking during the opponent's turn.

### Sources
[[Vigilance]], [Rule 702.20 (Vigilance)]",Yes,5,CORRECT,"The Bot's final ruling accurately states that a creature with vigilance does not tap when it attacks, which aligns perfectly with the Ground Truth.

74,What is 'Milling'?,"Milling refers to putting cards directly from the top of a library into the graveyard. It does not count as drawing cards. If a player is forced to mill their entire deck, they lose the next time they are required to draw a card.",easy,"Zones, Objects & State-Based Actions","Ah, the concept of milling! It is a fundamental mechanic in the realm of Magic: The Gathering that often eludes the uninitiated. 

### 1. The Interaction
Milling refers to the act of putting cards from the top of a player's library into their graveyard. This can be executed through various cards and abilities, such as Millikin or Millstone, which specifically utilize this mechanic.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
To understand milling, one must first grasp the definition provided by the rules. According to Rule 701.17, to mill a number of cards means that a player puts that many cards from the top of their library into their graveyard. 

- **Milling Mechanics**: When a card instructs a player to mill, it specifies how many cards to mill. For instance, Millstone allows you to mill two cards. However, if a player has fewer than two cards in their library, Rule 701.17b states that they cannot mill more cards than they possess. Thus, they will mill as many as they can, which could be zero or one card.
  
- **Information and Choices**: If an ability checks information about the milled cards, Rule 701.17d clarifies that it refers to each of the milled cards. This means if an ability requires information about a single milled card, it will receive multiple answers if more than one card is milled. The player controlling the ability can choose which card to affect if the action refers to ""a"" card.

### 3. The Ruling
In summary, milling is the process of moving cards from the top of a library to the graveyard, and it is governed by specific rules that dictate how many cards can be milled based on the library's size.

### Sources

75,Does a -5/-5 effect kill an Indestructible 3/4 creature?,"Yes. Indestructible prevents destruction from damage or 'destroy' effects. However, if a creature's toughness is reduced to 0 or less by -X/-X effects, it is put into the graveyard as a State-Based Action. This is not 'destruction,' so Indestructible does not save it.",easy,"Zones, Objects & State-Based Actions","Ah, the intricacies of power and toughness adjustments! Let us delve into the mechanics at play here.

### 1. The Interaction
We are examining a scenario where an indestructible creature with a base toughness of 4 is affected by an effect that gives it -5/-5. 

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Initial State**: The creature in question has a base toughness of 4 and possesses the indestructible ability, which means it cannot be destroyed by lethal damage or effects that say ""destroy"" (Rule 702.12b).
- **Applying the Effect**: When the -5/-5 effect is applied, the creature's toughness is calculated as follows: 4 (original toughness) - 5 = -1. Thus, the creature now has a toughness of -1.
- **State-Based Actions**: According to the rules, a creature with toughness 0 or less is put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action (Rule 704.5g). Since the creature's toughness is now -1, it meets this criterion.
- **Indestructibility Check**: While the creature is indestructible, this ability does not prevent it from being put into the graveyard for having 0 or less toughness. Indestructibility only protects against destruction from lethal damage or destroy effects, not from state-based actions due to low toughness.

### 3. The Ruling
Therefore, the -5/-5 effect does indeed cause the indestructible 3/4 creature to be put into the graveyard due to having a toughness of -1.

Let us delve into the interaction between your double-striking creature and its blocker.

### 1. The Interaction
You have a 2/2 creature with double strike that is being blocked by a 2/2 creature without abilities. The key mechanics at play here are double strike and the rules governing combat damage assignment.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Double Strike Mechanics**: A creature with double strike deals damage in both the first and second combat damage steps. This means it will deal its damage twice: once during the first strike damage step and again during the regular damage step.
  
- **First Combat Damage Step**: As the combat damage step begins, your 2/2 double strike creature will assign 2 damage to the 2/2 blocker. The blocker, being a 2/2, will also deal its 2 damage back to your creature. Since both creatures have equal power, they will destroy each other in this step.

- **Second Combat Damage Step**: After the first combat damage step concludes, we proceed to the second combat damage step. However, since your 2/2 creature with double strike has already been destroyed in the first step, it is no longer on the battlefield to deal damage again. The 2/2 blocker, having also been destroyed, will not deal any damage either.

Crucially, observe that both creatures will be sent to the graveyard as a result of the damage dealt in the first combat damage step, and thus there will be no further damage assignment in the second step.

### 3. The Ruling
Both your 2/2 double strike creature and the 2/2 blocker will be destroyed in the first combat damage step, resulting in no damage being dealt in the second combat damage step.

### 1. The Interaction
The key card in question is your creature with menace, which inherently alters the blocking dynamics. Menace dictates that a creature with this ability cannot be blocked except by two or more creatures.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Understanding Menace**: According to Rule 702.111b, a creature with menace cannot be blocked by a single creature. This is a fundamental aspect of the ability, designed to enhance the creature's evasion in combat.
- **Blocking Requirements**: When your opponent is faced with a creature that has menace, they must adhere to this rule. If they attempt to block, they must do so with at least two creatures. 
- **Declare Blockers Step**: During the declare blockers step, the defending player checks their available creatures. If they only have one creature available to block, they cannot legally declare that creature as a blocker against your menace creature.

78,"If I cast [[Clone]] copying a creature that has three +1/+1 counters on it, does my [[Clone]] enter with those counters?","No. Copy effects only copy what is written on the card (plus other copy effects). They do not copy 'external' modifications like counters, Auras, or temporary buffs (like Giant Growth). Your Clone will enter as a fresh version of that creature with zero counters.",medium,"Continuous Effects, Layers & Copying","Ah, a most intriguing inquiry regarding the nature of copying and counters! Let us delve into the mechanics of Clone and the intricacies of its copying ability.

### 1. The Interaction
The key cards in this scenario are Clone, which is a shapeshifter that can enter as a copy of any creature on the battlefield, and the creature you are copying, which has three +1/+1 counters on it.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- When Clone enters the battlefield as a copy of the chosen creature, it does so by applying the rules governing copying.
- According to Rule 707.2, when Clone copies a creature, it acquires the copiable values of that creature's characteristics. However, it is crucial to note that Clone only copies the printed characteristics of the original creature, which includes its name, mana cost, type, power, toughness, and abilities.
- Importantly, Clone does **not** copy any counters that are currently on the original creature. This is explicitly stated in the rulings regarding Clone, which clarify that it does not copy any non-copy effects, including counters.
- Therefore, while Clone will have the same power and toughness as the creature it is copying (which would be modified by the counters), it does not enter the battlefield with those counters itself.

### 3. The Ruling
Thus, your Clone will enter as a copy of the creature, but it will not have the three +1/+1 counters; it will simply have the base power and toughness of the original creature without any modifications from counters.

79,Can I use [[Lightning Bolt]] to destroy a Planeswalker?,"Yes. Any spell or ability that says 'any target' can target a Planeswalker directly. If the damage deals enough to remove all the Planeswalker's loyalty counters, it is put into the graveyard.",medium,"Costs, Mana & Casting Requirements","Ah, the intricacies of damage and planeswalker interactions! Let us delve into this matter with precision.

### 1. The Interaction
The key card in question is **Lightning Bolt**, an instant that deals 3 damage to any target. The target here is a **planeswalker**, which is a type of permanent that can be damaged.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Step 1: Targeting** - When you cast Lightning Bolt, you choose a planeswalker as the target. This is permissible, as Lightning Bolt can target any creature, planeswalker, or battle.
- **Step 2: Damage Resolution** - Upon resolution, Lightning Bolt deals 3 damage to the targeted planeswalker. According to Rule 120.3c, this damage results in the removal of 3 loyalty counters from that planeswalker.
- **Step 3: State-Based Actions** - If the planeswalker’s loyalty counters are reduced to zero as a result of this damage, it will be put into its owner’s graveyard as a state-based action (Rule 704). However, if the planeswalker has 3 or more loyalty counters before the damage is dealt, it will survive the encounter.

Crucially, observe that while Lightning Bolt does not destroy the planeswalker directly, the damage it inflicts can lead to the planeswalker’s destruction if it reduces its loyalty to zero.

### 3. The Ruling
Yes, you can use Lightning Bolt to destroy a planeswalker, provided that the planeswalker has 3 or fewer loyalty counters when the damage is dealt.

### Sources

However, a red spell that says 'Destroy all creatures' (without damage) would still kill it.",medium,Combat & Damage Mechanics,"Ah, the intricacies of protection mechanics! Let us delve into the nuances of how protection interacts with damage sources.

### 1. The Interaction
The key card in question is **Blasphemous Act**, a red sorcery that deals 13 damage to each creature. We are examining the scenario where a creature possesses **Protection from Red**.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Understanding Protection**: A creature with Protection from Red cannot be dealt damage by red sources, which includes any red spells or abilities that would deal damage to it. This is a fundamental aspect of the protection mechanic, specifically outlined in Rule 702.16a.
  
- **Damage Event**: When Blasphemous Act resolves, it attempts to deal 13 damage to each creature. However, the protection ability re-evaluates the source of the damage at the moment it would be dealt (Rule 609.7b). Since Blasphemous Act is a red source, the damage it would deal to the creature with Protection from Red is prevented entirely.

- **Prevention of Damage**: The protection ability effectively creates a shield against damage from red sources. Thus, when the damage event occurs, the creature with Protection from Red will not take any damage from Blasphemous Act, as the damage is prevented (Rule 702.16e).

### 3. The Ruling
A creature with Protection from Red does not take damage from Blasphemous Act, as the protection ability prevents damage from red sources.

### 1. The Interaction
You have cast a spell, and your opponent has responded by casting **Counterspell** to target it. The question at hand is whether you can cast another instant spell in response to this Counterspell to prevent your original spell from being countered.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Step 1: Casting the Original Spell**: When you cast your spell, it goes onto the stack, and your opponent gains priority.
- **Step 2: Opponent's Response**: Your opponent then casts **Counterspell** targeting your original spell. This action is taken ""in response to"" your spell, as per Rule 117.7.
- **Step 3: Your Priority**: After your opponent casts Counterspell, they pass priority back to you. At this point, you still have the opportunity to respond before Counterspell resolves.
- **Step 4: Casting Another Instant**: You may indeed cast another instant spell in response to the Counterspell. This is permissible because you have priority and the stack is not empty; you are simply adding another layer to the stack.

Crucially, the resolution order will be that your newly cast instant will resolve first, followed by the Counterspell, and finally your original spell, assuming it survives the Counterspell.

### 3. The Ruling

### 1. The Interaction
The key card in question is a creature with Ward {2}. Your opponent targets this creature with a spell but cannot pay the required cost of {2}.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Ward Mechanic**: The ward ability is a triggered ability that activates whenever the creature becomes the target of a spell or ability controlled by an opponent. In this case, the ward ability will trigger when your opponent targets the creature.
- **Cost Requirement**: The ward ability states that the spell or ability targeting the creature will be countered unless the opponent pays {2}. Since your opponent cannot pay this cost, we must consider the implications.
- **Countering the Spell**: Because the opponent fails to pay the cost, the spell targeting the creature is countered. This is a direct consequence of the ward ability's stipulation.

### 3. The Ruling
The spell targeting the creature is countered because your opponent cannot pay the {2} cost required by the ward ability.

### Sources

84,Does First Strike work when creatures 'fight' using a spell like [[Prey Upon]]?,No. First Strike and Double Strike only apply during specific Combat Damage steps. 'Fight' is a spell effect that causes two creatures to deal damage equal to their power to each other simultaneously. Combat keywords are ignored.,medium,Combat & Damage Mechanics,"Ah, the intricacies of combat mechanics and spell interactions! Let us delve into the nuances of how first strike operates in the context of a fight.

### 1. The Interaction
The key card in question is **Prey Upon**, a sorcery that allows a target creature you control to fight a target creature you do not control. The mechanics of fighting involve each creature dealing damage equal to its power to the other. The question arises: does first strike apply in this scenario?

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Understanding Fighting**: When two creatures fight, they deal damage simultaneously, rather than in a sequential manner as seen in combat. This is crucial because the rules governing combat damage and the first strike ability do not apply to fights.
- **First Strike Mechanics**: First strike is a static ability that modifies the combat damage step, allowing creatures with first strike to deal damage before those without it. However, since fighting is not part of the combat damage step, first strike does not influence the outcome of a fight.
- **Resolution of Prey Upon**: When **Prey Upon** resolves, both creatures involved in the fight will deal damage to each other simultaneously, regardless of whether either creature has first strike. Thus, the first strike ability has no bearing on the fight.

### 3. The Ruling
First strike does not apply when creatures fight using **Prey Upon**, as fighting does not occur in the combat damage step.

85,"If I create a token copy of a card with Mana Value (CMC) 5, what is the Mana Value of the token?","The token has a Mana Value of 5. Unlike generic tokens (like a 1/1 Soldier) which have a Mana Value of 0, a token that is a *copy* of a card copies all characteristics of the original, including its Mana Cost.",medium,"Continuous Effects, Layers & Copying","Ah, the intricacies of mana value and token creation! Let us delve into this fascinating topic.

### 1. The Interaction
You are inquiring about the mana value of a token created as a copy of a card with a converted mana cost (CMC) of 5.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
To determine the mana value of the token, we must first recall the fundamental principle regarding token copies. According to the rules, when a token is created as a copy of another permanent, it copies the characteristics of that permanent as stated by the effect that created it. However, crucially, if the copied permanent has a mana cost that includes {X}, or if it is a melded permanent, the mana value of the token will be 0.

In this case, since you are copying a card with a mana value of 5, we must consider whether the original card has any special conditions that would affect its mana value when copied. If the original card is not a token itself and does not involve any {X} or meld mechanics, the token will indeed have the same mana value as the original.

However, if the original card is a token or has any of the aforementioned conditions, the token created will have a mana value of 0. 

### 3. The Ruling
Thus, if you create a token copy of a card with a mana value of 5, the token will have a mana value of 5, provided the original card is not a token or affected by any special conditions.

### 1. The Interaction
The key card in question is the planeswalker, which possesses activated abilities that can be utilized during your turn. The query revolves around whether these abilities can be activated during your opponent's turn.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Understanding Priority**: A player may only activate abilities when they have priority. During your opponent's turn, it is primarily their opportunity to act, and you do not have priority unless a specific event allows you to gain it.
- **Timing of Activation**: According to Rule 117.1b, a player may activate an activated ability any time they have priority. However, during your opponent's turn, unless a specific effect grants you priority (such as a triggered ability or an instant spell), you cannot activate your planeswalker's abilities.
- **Main Phase Requirement**: Furthermore, planeswalker abilities can only be activated during your main phase when the stack is empty. Since your opponent's turn does not include your main phase, you are unable to activate those abilities at that time.

87,"If I have a 1/1 creature with both Deathtouch and First Strike, and it blocks a 10/10 creature without abilities, does my creature die?","No, your creature survives. Because of First Strike, your creature deals damage in the first combat damage step. Because of Deathtouch, that 1 damage is immediately lethal. The 10/10 dies and is removed from combat before the regular damage step occurs, so it never gets a chance to hit your creature back.",medium,Combat & Damage Mechanics,"Ah, a delightful inquiry into the intricacies of combat mechanics! Let us dissect this scenario with precision.

### 1. The Interaction
You have a 1/1 creature equipped with both Deathtouch and First Strike, blocking a 10/10 creature that possesses no abilities. The crux of the matter lies in how these abilities interact during the combat damage step.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **First Strike Mechanic**: Since your creature has First Strike, it will assign its combat damage before the regular combat damage step. This means it will deal its damage first, which is 1 damage in this case.
- **Deathtouch Effect**: The presence of Deathtouch means that any amount of damage dealt by your creature is considered lethal damage. Thus, when your 1/1 creature deals 1 damage to the 10/10 creature, that damage is sufficient to destroy it.
- **State-Based Actions**: After the First Strike damage is assigned, state-based actions are checked. The 10/10 creature, having received lethal damage, is destroyed as a result of the Deathtouch rule.

However, we must also consider the 10/10 creature's combat damage. In the regular combat damage step, the 10/10 creature will assign its damage to your 1/1 creature. Since it has a power of 10, it will deal 10 damage to your 1/1 creature, which exceeds its toughness of 1.

- **Final Outcome**: After the First Strike damage is resolved, the 10/10 creature will still deal its 10 damage to your 1/1 creature, which will result in the destruction of your creature due to having 0 toughness.

### 1. The Interaction
You control both **Doubling Season** and **Parallel Lives**, and you wish to activate **Luminarch Ascension** to create a single 4/4 Angel token.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Step 1: Activation of Luminarch Ascension**: When you activate Luminarch Ascension's ability, you are instructed to create a single 4/4 Angel token. This is the initial event that triggers the token creation.
  
- **Step 2: Doubling Season's Effect**: According to the rules, when an effect creates tokens, **Doubling Season** applies first. It states that if an effect would create one or more tokens, it creates twice that many instead. Thus, instead of creating one Angel token, you will create two.

- **Step 3: Parallel Lives' Effect**: Next, we apply **Parallel Lives**. This enchantment also states that if an effect would create one or more tokens, it creates twice that many. Since you now have two tokens from Doubling Season, Parallel Lives will double that number again, resulting in four tokens.

- **Final Calculation**: Therefore, the sequence of effects leads to the creation of four 4/4 Angel tokens in total.

89,What is the difference between 'Graveyard' and 'Exile'?,"The Graveyard is where cards go when they die, are discarded, or countered. Many cards interact with the graveyard (reanimation, flashback). Exile is a separate zone (formerly 'removed from the game') where cards go when specifically banished. Very few cards can bring things back from Exile.",medium,"Zones, Objects & State-Based Actions","Ah, the distinction between zones in Magic: The Gathering is a fundamental concept that every player should grasp. Let us delve into the nuances of the 'Graveyard' and 'Exile' zones.

### 1. The Interaction
We are comparing two distinct zones: the 'Graveyard' and the 'Exile' zone. Each serves a unique purpose within the game.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Graveyard**: This zone is essentially a player's discard pile, where cards go when they are destroyed, discarded, or otherwise removed from the battlefield. According to Rule 404, a graveyard contains all the cards that a player has discarded or lost during the game. Players can examine the cards in their graveyard at any time, but they typically cannot change the order of those cards.
  
- **Exile**: In contrast, the exile zone is a holding area for cards that have been removed from the game, as defined in Rule 406. Cards can be exiled temporarily or permanently, depending on the effect that caused them to leave their previous zone. Exiled cards are not accessible for most interactions unless a specific effect allows them to return or interact with the game in some way.

Crucially, the two zones differ in their accessibility and the implications of being in each. Cards in the graveyard can often be targeted by spells and abilities, while cards in exile cannot be targeted unless a specific effect allows it, as noted in the rulings for Silent Gravestone.

### 3. The Ruling
In summary, the 'Graveyard' is a player's discard pile where cards are kept after being used or destroyed, while 'Exile' is a separate zone where cards are removed from the game, often temporarily, and cannot be targeted by spells or abilities unless specified.

### Sources

### 1. The Interaction
You are inquiring about the resolution of an Adventure creature spell, specifically using Bonecrusher Giant as an example.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- When you cast Bonecrusher Giant as an Adventure, you are actually casting the instant part of the card, known as ""Stomp."" 
- According to the rules, when an Adventure spell resolves, it does not go to the graveyard as one might expect. Instead, it is exiled. This is a crucial distinction.
- The relevant rule states that instead of being put into the graveyard, the Adventure card is exiled, allowing you to cast the creature portion later from exile. This means that while the Adventure spell is on the stack, it behaves as an instant, but once it resolves, it transitions to being exiled rather than going to the graveyard.

### 3. The Ruling
Thus, when you cast Bonecrusher Giant as an Adventure, it does not go to the graveyard after it resolves; instead, it is exiled, allowing you to cast the creature later.

91,My opponent casts [[Deadly Dispute]]. Can I kill the creature they are sacrificing in response to make the spell fizzle?,"No, you cannot.

### 1. The Interaction
Your opponent has cast **Deadly Dispute**, which requires them to sacrifice an artifact or creature as an additional cost to cast the spell. You are considering whether you can destroy the creature they intend to sacrifice in response, thereby causing the spell to fizzle.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Step 1: Understanding Costs**: When a player casts **Deadly Dispute**, they must choose and sacrifice an artifact or creature as part of the spell's cost. This action occurs immediately as the spell is being cast, before it even goes on the stack.
- **Step 2: Timing of Responses**: You may respond to the spell once it is on the stack. However, the key point here is that the cost of sacrificing a creature is already determined at the time of casting. 
- **Step 3: The Fizzle Condition**: According to Rule 701.12a, if an exchange (in this case, the sacrifice of a creature) cannot be completed, then no part of the exchange occurs. However, since the sacrifice is a cost that must be paid when casting the spell, it is not contingent upon the spell resolving. 
- **Step 4: Independence of Actions**: Once the spell is cast, it exists independently of its source. Thus, even if you destroy the creature they intended to sacrifice, the spell will still resolve, as the cost has already been paid.

### 3. The Ruling
You cannot kill the creature in response to make **Deadly Dispute** fizzle; the spell will still resolve as the sacrifice is a cost that has already been paid.

- **Deathtouch**: This ability stipulates that any amount of damage dealt to a creature is considered lethal damage. Thus, even a single point of damage from your creature will suffice to satisfy the lethal damage requirement for the blocking creature.
- **Trample**: When a creature with trample is blocked, the controller must assign enough damage to the blocking creature to meet the lethal damage threshold before assigning any excess damage to the defending player or planeswalker. 

Now, since your creature has deathtouch, you only need to assign **1 damage** to the blocking creature to fulfill the lethal damage requirement. After that, any remaining damage can be assigned to the defending player or planeswalker.

Crucially, if your creature has, for example, a power of 5, you would assign 1 damage to the blocker (due to deathtouch) and then the remaining 4 damage can be assigned to the defending player or planeswalker.

### 3. The Ruling
You must assign at least 1 damage to the blocking creature, and any excess damage can be assigned to the defending player or planeswalker.

### Sources
[[Rule 702.19b]], [[Rule 702.2c]]",Yes,5,CORRECT,"The Bot's final ruling correctly states that you must assign at least 1 damage to the blocking creature due to deathtouch, which satisfies the lethal damage requirement for trample. This aligns perfectly with the Ground Truth, which also emphasizes that only 1 damage is needed to fulfill this requirement, allowing any remaining damage to be assigned to the defending player or planeswalker. The logic provided in section 2 supports this ruling, and the reference to the relevant rules adds to the quality of the answer."
93,Does [[Garruk's Harbinger]] (which has Hexproof from Black) survive a [[Damnation]]?,"No, it does not survive. This happens because Hexproof from Black only prevents the creature from being targeted by black spells or abilities. Damnation does not use the word 'target'—it simply says 'destroy all creatures.' Since it affects the board globally without targeting specific objects, the Hexproof offers no protection, and the Harbinger is destroyed.",medium,"Zones, Objects & State-Based Actions","Ah, the intricate dance of hexproof and destruction! Let us delve into the mechanics at play here.

### 1. The Interaction
We have Garruk's Harbinger, a creature with hexproof from black, facing Damnation, a sorcery that destroys all creatures without the possibility of regeneration.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Hexproof from Black**: Garruk's Harbinger possesses the ability ""hexproof from black,"" which means it cannot be targeted by spells or abilities controlled by opponents that are black in nature. This is a crucial distinction, as it protects the Harbinger from being directly targeted by black spells.
  
- **Damnation's Effect**: Damnation does not target creatures; rather, it destroys all creatures on the battlefield. The key here is that destruction occurs as a state-based action after the resolution of the spell, not as a direct targeting of the creature.

- **State-Based Actions**: According to Rule 120.5, damage dealt to a creature does not destroy it immediately; rather, state-based actions check for conditions that would lead to a creature's destruction. Since Damnation destroys all creatures, it does not interact with Garruk's Harbinger through targeting, thus bypassing the hexproof from black.

- **Conclusion**: Since Garruk's Harbinger is not targeted by Damnation, it does not lose its hexproof from black, and thus, it is not protected from the destruction that Damnation causes. 

### 3. The Ruling
Garruk's Harbinger does not survive Damnation; it is destroyed along with all other creatures.

### Sources
[[Garruk's Harbinger]], [Rule 702.11d (Hexproof from quality)]  
[[Damnation]], [Rule 120.5 (Damage and State-Based Actions)]",No,5,CORRECT,"The Bot's final ruling in section 3 correctly states that Garruk's Harbinger does not survive Damnation, aligning perfectly with the Ground Truth. The Bot's explanation in section 2 accurately describes the mechanics of hexproof from black and how Damnation operates without targeting, which supports the conclusion that the Harbinger is destroyed. The rules cited are relevant and reinforce the ruling, making the answer both technically correct and well-supported."
94,"If I cast [[Banishing Light]] and my opponent destroys it while its 'enters the battlefield' trigger is still on the stack, is the target exiled forever?","No, the target is never exiled at all. This happens because Banishing Light uses a modern single-paragraph wording ('exile... until Banishing Light leaves'). If the enchantment leaves the battlefield before the trigger resolves, the duration of the exile effect expires before it can even begin. The ability sees that the card is already gone and does nothing.",medium,"Zones, Objects & State-Based Actions","Ah, a delightful inquiry into the nuances of triggered abilities and the stack! Let us dissect this interaction with precision.

### 1. The Interaction
You are casting **Banishing Light**, which has a triggered ability that exiles a target nonland permanent when it enters the battlefield. However, your opponent responds by destroying **Banishing Light** while its triggered ability is still on the stack.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- When you cast **Banishing Light**, it enters the battlefield and its triggered ability is placed on the stack, targeting a nonland permanent controlled by your opponent.
- Crucially, if your opponent destroys **Banishing Light** before its triggered ability resolves, the enchantment is no longer on the battlefield. According to the rules, if the source of a triggered ability is removed before that ability resolves, the ability will not have any effect on the target.
- Specifically, Rule 603.7c states that a delayed triggered ability that refers to a particular object still affects it even if the object changes characteristics. However, if that object is no longer in the zone it’s expected to be in at the time the delayed triggered ability resolves, the ability won’t affect it. In this case, since **Banishing Light** is no longer on the battlefield, the target permanent will not be exiled.

### 3. The Ruling
Thus, the target will not be exiled at all; it remains on the battlefield as if nothing had happened.

### Sources
[[Banishing Light]], [Rule 603.7c (Delayed Triggered Abilities)]",No,5,CORRECT,"The Bot's final ruling correctly states that the target will not be exiled at all, which aligns with the Ground Truth. The Bot accurately explains that if Banishing Light is destroyed before its triggered ability resolves, the target permanent remains on the battlefield and is not exiled. The logic provided in section 2 supports this conclusion, and the reference to Rule 603.7c is appropriate for the situation described."
95,Can I look at my sideboard during a game?,No. You may only look at your sideboard between games in a match. You cannot reference it or notes during the game itself (unless a card like 'Wish' specifically lets you access it).,medium,"Zones, Objects & State-Based Actions","Ah, the nuances of game mechanics often lead to delightful inquiries! 

### 1. The Interaction
The key card in question is the concept of the sideboard, which is a collection of additional cards that players may use to modify their decks between games of a match. 

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
Firstly, it is essential to understand that the sideboard is considered to be ""outside the game"" during play, as per Rule 400.11a. However, the rules explicitly state that players are permitted to look at their sideboard at any time. This is particularly relevant in tournament settings, where the sideboard must consist of cards that adhere to specific format restrictions, such as a maximum of fifteen cards in constructed formats (Rule 100.4a).

Crucially, this means that while you cannot play cards from your sideboard during the game unless specified by a card effect (such as ""Wish"" or ""Mastermind's Acquisition""), you are indeed allowed to examine the contents of your sideboard freely. This access to your sideboard is a strategic advantage, allowing you to consider potential modifications for subsequent games.

### 3. The Ruling
Yes, you may look at your sideboard during a game.

### Sources

96,"I am attacking with a Lifelink creature (without Trample). My opponent blocks it, then sacrifices his creature. Do I still gain life?","No, you do not gain life. This happens because a blocked creature without Trample deals damage only to the creature blocking it. If the blocker is removed before damage calculation, the attacker is still considered blocked but assigns zero damage because there is nothing left to hit. Since Lifelink requires actual damage to be dealt to function, you gain no life.",medium,Combat & Damage Mechanics,"Ah, the intricacies of combat and lifelink! Let us delve into this scenario with the precision it deserves.

### 1. The Interaction
You are attacking with a creature that has lifelink, and your opponent blocks it with their creature, which they subsequently sacrifice. The key mechanics at play here are the lifelink ability and the timing of damage resolution in combat.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Combat Damage Assignment**: When your lifelink creature deals damage to the blocking creature, the damage event is initiated. According to Rule 702.15b, damage dealt by a source with lifelink causes its controller to gain life equal to the damage dealt.
- **Sacrifice Timing**: Your opponent sacrifices their blocking creature after damage has been assigned but before it resolves. However, the lifelink ability is triggered at the moment damage is dealt, not when the creature is still on the battlefield.
- **Independence of Abilities**: The lifelink ability functions independently of the source once the damage is dealt. Thus, even if the blocking creature is sacrificed, the lifelink effect has already been triggered, and you will gain life based on the damage dealt.

### 3. The Ruling
You will still gain life equal to the damage dealt by your lifelink creature, despite your opponent sacrificing their blocking creature.

### Sources
[[Lifelink]], [Rule 702.15b (Lifelink)]",Yes,1,INCORRECT,"The Bot's final ruling states that you will still gain life from the lifelink creature despite the opponent sacrificing their blocking creature. This contradicts the Ground Truth, which clearly states that you do not gain life because the blocked creature without Trample deals damage only to the creature blocking it, and if the blocker is removed before damage calculation, the attacker assigns zero damage. The cited rule (702.15b) is misapplied, as lifelink requires actual damage to be dealt to function, which does not occur in this scenario."
97,"I control [[Monastery Swiftspear]]. If I cast [[Shattering Spree]] and pay the Replicate cost twice, do I get 1 or 3 Prowess triggers?","You get only 1 trigger. This happens because Prowess triggers specifically when you cast a spell. Replicate creates copies that are placed directly onto the stack; these copies are not 'cast.' Therefore, Swiftspear sees only the original spell being cast, regardless of how many copies you make.",medium,"Costs, Mana & Casting Requirements","Ah, a delightful inquiry into the intricacies of triggered abilities and replication! Let us dissect this interaction with precision.

### 1. The Interaction
You are casting **Shattering Spree**, which has the replicate ability, while controlling **Monastery Swiftspear**, a creature with prowess. The question revolves around how many prowess triggers you will receive when you pay the replicate cost twice.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Casting Shattering Spree**: When you cast **Shattering Spree**, you initiate the spell's effects, including its replicate ability. 
- **Paying the Replicate Cost**: You choose to pay the replicate cost twice. According to the rules governing replicate, this means you will create two copies of **Shattering Spree** on the stack.
- **Prowess Trigger**: The prowess ability of **Monastery Swiftspear** triggers whenever you cast a noncreature spell. Since you are casting **Shattering Spree** (a noncreature spell), prowess will trigger.
- **Replicate and Prowess**: Importantly, the prowess ability triggers once for the original spell cast, regardless of how many times you paid the replicate cost. The copies created by replicate do not trigger prowess again because they are not considered ""cast"" spells; they are simply created on the stack.

Thus, you will receive **one prowess trigger** from the original casting of **Shattering Spree**, not three.

### 3. The Ruling
You will receive **1 prowess trigger** when you cast **Shattering Spree** and pay the replicate cost twice.

### Sources
[[Shattering Spree]], [Rule 702.56a (Replicate)]

98,"I have a [[Monastery Swiftspear]] and need one more Prowess trigger to win. Can I cast [[Spell Pierce]] even if there are no other spells on the stack, just to get the trigger?","No, you cannot. To cast a spell, you must be able to choose a legal target for it. Spell Pierce specifically requires a 'target noncreature spell' to be on the stack. If there are no spells on the stack to target, the game does not allow you to cast Spell Pierce at all, so Prowess never triggers.",medium,"Costs, Mana & Casting Requirements","Ah, the intricacies of spellcasting and triggered abilities! Let us delve into the mechanics at play here.

### 1. The Interaction
You wish to cast **Spell Pierce** while controlling **Monastery Swiftspear** to trigger its prowess ability. The key cards here are **Spell Pierce**, an instant spell, and **Monastery Swiftspear**, which has the prowess ability.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Casting Spell Pierce**: When you cast **Spell Pierce**, it is indeed a noncreature spell, which means it will trigger the prowess ability of **Monastery Swiftspear**.
- **Prowess Trigger**: The prowess ability triggers as soon as you cast **Spell Pierce**. This trigger goes on the stack above **Spell Pierce** itself.
- **Resolution of Triggers**: The prowess trigger will resolve before **Spell Pierce** resolves. Thus, **Monastery Swiftspear** will receive a +1/+1 counter, becoming a 2/3 creature if it was originally a 1/2.
- **Countering the Spell**: Importantly, even if **Spell Pierce** is countered (which it will be unless its controller pays {2}), the prowess trigger still resolves, and **Monastery Swiftspear** will still gain the +1/+1 until end of turn.

Crucially, do not be misled by the notion that a spell must have other spells on the stack to trigger prowess; it is sufficient for you to cast a noncreature spell, regardless of the state of the stack.

### 3. The Ruling
Yes, you can cast **Spell Pierce** to trigger prowess on **Monastery Swiftspear**, and it will gain the +1/+1 even if **Spell Pierce** is countered.

99,"If I attack with a creature with Trample and it becomes blocked, and I kill the blocker before the damage step, does the damage from my creature go through?","Yes, all the damage goes through. This happens because Trample modifies the rules for blocked creatures. While a normal creature deals no damage if its blocker is removed, a creature with Trample checks to see how much damage is needed to kill the blocker. Since there is no blocker present, the required amount is zero, allowing the full power of the attacking creature to trample over to the defending player.",medium,Combat & Damage Mechanics,"Ah, a delightful inquiry into the nuances of combat mechanics! Let us dissect this scenario with precision.

### 1. The Interaction
You are attacking with a creature that possesses trample, and it becomes blocked by an opposing creature. Subsequently, you destroy the blocking creature before the combat damage step occurs. 

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Trample Mechanics**: Recall that trample allows an attacking creature to assign damage to the defending player or planeswalker after assigning lethal damage to the blocking creature(s). The key here is understanding what constitutes ""lethal damage.""
  
- **Combat Damage Step**: When the combat damage step begins, if your creature with trample is blocked, it must assign damage to the blocker first. However, if the blocker is destroyed before this step, it will not be present to receive any damage.

- **Lethal Damage Assignment**: According to Rule 702.19b, if there are no creatures blocking your attacking creature when damage is assigned, it can assign all its damage to the defending player or planeswalker. Since you have removed the blocker before the damage step, your creature effectively has no blockers to assign damage to.

- **Final Outcome**: Thus, when the combat damage step occurs, your creature with trample will assign its damage directly to the defending player or planeswalker, as it is treated as if all blocking creatures have been assigned lethal damage.

### 3. The Ruling
Yes, the damage from your creature with trample will go through to the defending player or planeswalker if the blocker is destroyed before the combat damage step.

### Sources

Let us delve into the precise moment when a Vehicle ceases to be a creature.

### 1. The Interaction
We are examining the moment a Vehicle, such as Mobile Garrison or Renegade Freighter, is crewed and subsequently attacks. The key aspect here is understanding when it transitions back to its original state as an artifact.

### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)
- **Crew Activation**: When you activate the crew ability of a Vehicle, you tap creatures with sufficient total power to pay the cost. This action resolves, and the Vehicle becomes an artifact creature until the end of turn.
- **Attacking Declaration**: The Vehicle must be a creature at the moment the declare attackers step begins. Once declared as an attacker, it behaves like any other creature.
- **End of Turn**: The critical point to note is that the Vehicle remains an artifact creature until the end of turn. After the turn concludes, it reverts to being just an artifact, losing its creature status.

Crucially, the Vehicle does not stop being a creature immediately after the combat phase or when it is no longer attacking; rather, it retains its creature status throughout the turn until the end of that turn.
