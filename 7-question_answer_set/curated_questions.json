    "question": "I control [[Vizier of Remedies]] and [[Devoted Druid]]. Can I generate infinite Green mana?",
    "accepted_answer": "Yes, you can. This works because the Vizier creates a replacement effect that modifies the cost of the Druid's untap ability. When you activate the Druid, the cost requires putting a -1/-1 counter on it, but the Vizier reduces that number by one, meaning you effectively pay 0 counters. Since the Druid never actually receives the counter, it doesn't shrink or die, allowing you to untap it infinitely.",

If the target is removed (destroyed, exiled, or bounced) before the ability resolves, the ability has no legal targets left and fails completely (fizzles).

Since the game applies the 'Mountain' type before removing the Dryad's text, Valakut triggers will still function normally.

    "accepted_answer": "Yes, the Dragonhawk's end-step ability will still trigger and deal 4 damage to your opponent, even though it died, because the ability creates a delayed trigger that exists independently on the stack, separate from its source. The key is that the ability triggered and put the cards into exile and the damage effect on the stack; as long as the cards are still in exile, the delayed trigger resolves and deals damage based on those specific exiled cards.",

This happens because activated abilities exist independently of their source once placed on the stack; removing The One Ring does not counter the ability. Although a new burden counter cannot be added to the now-exiled card, the game uses Last Known Information to recall the two counters present when it left the battlefield, allowing the draw effect to resolve based on that count.",

This happens because both effects (Purphoros trying to revert to a non-creature enchantment and the Aura forcing him to be a Toy creature) apply in Layer 4. Since the Aura entered the battlefield later, its timestamp wins the conflict and overwrites Purphoros's natural state.

When a spell with X in its mana cost is on the stack, the value of X is the number chosen for it when it was cast.

This is defined by Rule 611.3c, which establishes that continuous effects generated by a permanent apply simultaneously with its entry into the battlefield.

This happens because the Equip keyword specifically targets a creature controlled by the player activating the ability.

This happens because the token generation relies on Last Known Information to check her power (including the +2/+0) at the moment of death.

When you move the opponent's card from exile to the graveyard to pay Oracle's cost, Rest in Peace intercepts it and sends it right back to exile.

This happens because face-down creatures have no text or abilities, meaning the replacement effect (shuffle into library) simply does not exist at the moment the creature dies.

    "accepted_answer": "Yes, this creates an infinite damage loop, provided Walking Ballista has at least two +1/+1 counters. This happens because Heliod grants the Ballista Lifelink. When you remove a counter to deal damage, you gain life, which triggers Heliod to put a +1/+1 counter back on the Ballista. This effectively refunds the cost of the ability, allowing you to repeat the process indefinitely until you win. The Ballista must be a 2/2 or larger so it doesn't die when you remove the first counter.",

When your first activation resolves and the opponent pays the 1, their original spell is still on the stack waiting to resolve. Before it can resolve, the game must pass priority to you again, giving you the opportunity to activate the Hexcatcher a second time, sacrifice another Merfolk, and force them to pay another 1.

    "accepted_answer": "Yes, all the damage goes through. This happens because Trample modifies the rules for blocked creatures. While a normal creature deals no damage if its blocker is removed, a creature with Trample checks to see how much damage is needed to kill the blocker. Since there is no blocker present, the required amount is zero, allowing the full power of the attacking creature to trample over to the defending player.",

    "question": "If I crew a Vehicle to attack, at what specific moment does it stop being a creature?",
    "accepted_answer": "It stops being a creature during the Cleanup Step, which is the very last part of the turn. It remains a creature throughout combat, the second main phase, and the end step. It only reverts to being a non-creature artifact when 'until end of turn' effects wear off as the turn officially closes.",
