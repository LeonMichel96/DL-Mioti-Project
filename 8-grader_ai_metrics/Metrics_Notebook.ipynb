       " 'generated_answer': 'Ah, the intricacies of combat damage assignment! Let us delve into the mechanics of trample and deathtouch, which can often lead to confusion.\\n\\n### 1. The Interaction\\nYou are attacking with a creature that possesses both deathtouch and trample, and it has been blocked by an opposing creature. \\n\\n### 2. The Logic (Step-by-Step)\\n- **Deathtouch**: This ability stipulates that any amount of damage dealt to a creature is considered lethal damage. Thus, even a single point of damage from your creature is sufficient to satisfy the requirement for lethal damage.\\n- **Trample**: When a creature with trample is blocked, the controller must assign enough damage to the blocking creature to meet the lethal damage requirement before assigning any excess damage to the defending player or planeswalker. \\n\\nNow, since your creature has deathtouch, you need only assign **1 damage** to the blocking creature to satisfy the lethal damage requirement. After that, any remaining damage can be assigned to the defending player or planeswalker.\\n\\nCrucially, if your creature has, for example, a power of 5, you would assign 1 damage to the blocker (due to deathtouch) and the remaining 4 damage can be assigned to the defending player or planeswalker.\\n\\n### 3. The Ruling\\nYou must assign at least 1 damage to the blocking creature, and any excess damage can be assigned to the defending player or planeswalker.\\n\\n### Sources\\n[[Deathtouch]], [Rule 702.2c]  \\n[[Trample]], [Rule 702.19b]  \\n[[Combat Damage Assignment]], [Rule 510.1]',\n",

    "    IMPORTANT CONTEXT:\n",
    "    The Bot is programmed to act like a \"Grumpy Old Wizard\". It uses flavor text, insults, and roleplay (e.g., \"Read the text, boy!\", \"Hoo-hoo!\"). \n",
    "    YOU MUST IGNORE THE ROLEPLAY. Do not let the flavor text affect your technical evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    DATA:\n",
    "    - Question: {question}\n",
    "    - Ground Truth: {ground_truth}\n",
    "    - Bot's Answer: {model_answer}\n",
    "\n",
    "    STRICT EVALUATION PROTOCOL:\n",
    "    1. EXTRACT RULING: Go to \"**The Ruling**:\". If the ruling is there, the bot HAS answered and this is the final decision.\n",
    "    2. COMPARE: Compare the statement found in \"**The Ruling**\" against the Ground Truth.\n",
    "    3. CHECK CORE LOGIC: Does the bot's final decision (Yes/No/Can/Cannot) match the Ground Truth's decision?\n",
    "    4. RULE VERIFICATION: If the bot cites a Rule Number (e.g., 704.5j), check if that rule is relevant to the topic.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    STRICT RULES:\n",
    "    - The Bot is allowed to be verbose in sections before the ruling.\n",
    "    - An answer is CORRECT if the final verdict in section \"**The Rulling** matches the logic of the Ground Truth.\n",
    "    - NEVER penalize for the bot's \"arrogant\" or \"vague\" persona if the technical MTG ruling is correct.\n",
    "    - If the bot provides the correct rule number (e.g., 702.10 for Haste), it is a high-quality answer.\n",
